The population of the city of Honolulu was 337,256 as of the 2010 census, while the Honolulu CCD was 390,738 and the population of the consolidated city and county was 953,207.

Its satellite service, launched on June 17, 1994, transmits digital satellite television and audio to households in the United States, Latin America and the Caribbean. Its primary competitors are Dish Network and cable television providers. On July 24, 2015, after receiving approval from the United States Federal Communications Commission and United States Department of Justice, AT&T acquired DirecTV in a transaction valued at $48.5 billion. 

DirecTV provides television and audio services to subscribers through satellite transmissions. Services include the equivalent of many local television stations, broadcast television networks, subscription television services, satellite radio services, and private video services. Subscribers have access to hundreds of channels, so its competitors are cable television service and other satellite-based services. 

Most subscribers use reception antennas which are much smaller than the first generation antennas, which were typically a few yards (meters) across. Advances in antenna technology, including fractal antennas, have allowed a general reduction in antenna size across all industries and applications.

SHORT TITLE.

 This Act may be cited as the ``Human Rights Information Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

 Congress finds the following:
 (1) The people of the United States consider the national 
 and international protection and promotion of human rights and 
 the rule of law the most important values of any democracy. The 
 founding fathers defined human rights prominently in the Bill 
 of Rights, giving those rights a special priority and 
 protection in the Constitution.
 (2) Federal agencies are in possession of documents 
 pertaining to gross human rights violations abroad which are 
 needed by foreign authorities to document, investigate, and 
 subsequently prosecute instances of continued and systematic 
 gross human rights violations, including those directed against 
 citizens of the United States.
 (3) The United States will continue to receive requests 
 from foreign authorities for legal assistance regarding human 
 rights violations, including the declassification of documents. 
 In addition to requests by Guatemala and Honduras, a Spanish 
 court magistrate, Baltasar Garzon, recently requested from the 
 United States information on General Augusto Pinochet. 
 Currently, the United States responds to declassification 
 requests by following procedures outlined in Presidential 
 directives and executive orders. The overwhelming interest of 
 the United States in the protection and promotion of human 
 rights nationally and internationally requires a significant 
 strengthening of existing declassification procedures, 
 including section 552 of title 5, United States Code (commonly 
 known as the ``Freedom of Information Act'').
 (4) The expedient declassification of human rights 
 documents in full compliance with United States security 
 interests according to the procedures outlined in this Act will 
 protect global human rights by strengthening the rule of law 
 internationally, creating a crucial level of accountability of 
 Federal agencies, and will result in significant saving of 
 Government resources.
 (5) The commitment to the promotion and protection of human 
 rights and democracy around the world has led the United States 
 to undertake tremendous diplomatic, economic, and military 
 efforts to end systematic gross human rights violations abroad, 
 consistent with the national interests and international 
 leadership role of the United States. In addition, countless 
 humanitarian United States nongovernmental organizations and 
 citizens of the United States promote human rights and 
 democracy in foreign countries. These efforts are thwarted if 
 the cycle of impunity for human rights violations is not broken 
 in those countries, and the likelihood of the need for renewed 
 United States engagements in those areas remains.
 (6) The United States therefore has a significant interest 
 that newly established or reestablished democratic societies 
 take credible steps to fully investigate and prosecute human 
 rights violations. These steps can include the creation of a 
 national or international truth commission or tribunal, the 
 appointment of a human rights officer, or official national 
 investigations led by credible sections of the civil society, 
 including churches and nongovernmental organizations.
 (7) The United States has long provided international 
 leadership to end impunity for gross human rights violations 
 and to promote the rule of law around the world by establishing 
 and supporting the Nuremberg and Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal; in 
 addition, the United States has actively participated in, among 
 others, the International War Crimes Tribunals on the former 
 Yugoslavia and Rwanda.
 (8) The United States has ratified the Convention against 
 Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment, which in article 9 obligates parties to ``afford one 
another the greatest measure of assistance in connection with criminal 
proceedings brought in respect of any [acts of, attempts of, or 
complicity in acts of torture], including the supply of all evidence at 
their disposal necessary for the proceedings.'' In addition, as a 
member State of the Organization of American States, the United States 
should seek to follow the December 8, 1998, recommendation of the 
Inter-American Commission on Human Rights ``that member States of the 
Organization of American States adopt legislative and such other 
measures as may be necessary to effectuate the right of free access to 
information in files and documents in the power of the State, 
particularly in cases of investigations to establish criminal 
responsibility for international crimes and serious violations of human 
rights.''
 (9) The Guatemalan peace accords, which the Government of 
 the United States firmly supports, included as an important and 
 vital component an investigation and a report by the Commission 
 for the Historical Clarification of Human Rights Violations and 
 Acts of Violence which have Caused Suffering to the Guatemalan 
 People (referred to in this Act as the ``Clarification 
 Commission''). Despite the conclusion of this investigation, 
 many questions, including the identity of perpetrators of human 
 rights violations as well as the location of bodies of the 
 ``disappeared'', remain unanswered. The Clarification 
 Commission explicitly recommended that ``all available legal 
 and material resources should be utilized [by the Guatemalan 
 Government] to clarify the whereabouts of the disappeared and, 
 in the case of death, to deliver the remains to the 
 relatives.''
 (10) Two days after presenting a parallel investigation, 
 ``Guatemala: Never Again'', by the Historical Memory Recovery 
 Project by the Archbishop of Guatemala, the director of the 
 project, Bishop Juan Jose Gerardi, was assassinated.
 (11) President Clinton stated in Guatemala on March 10, 
 1999, that ``[f]or the United States, it is important that I 
 state clearly that support for military forces or intelligence 
 units which engaged in violent and widespread repression of the 
 kind described in the report [by the Clarification Commission] 
 was wrong, and the United States must not repeat that mistake. 
 We must, and we will, instead, continue to support the peace 
 and reconciliation process in Guatemala.''
 (12) The National Commissioner for the Protection of Human 
 Rights in the Republic of Honduras has been requesting 
 documentation of the United States on human rights violations 
 in Honduras since November 15, 1993. The Commissioner's request 
 has been partly fulfilled, but aspects of it are still pending.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

 In this Act:
 (1) Human rights record.--The term ``human rights record'' 
 means a record in the possession, custody, or control of the 
 United States Government containing information about gross 
 violations of internationally recognized human rights committed 
 after 1944.
 (2) Agency.--The term ``agency'' means any agency of the 
 United States Government charged with the conduct of foreign 
 policy or foreign intelligence, including, but not limited to, 
 the Department of State, the Agency for International 
 Development, the Department of Defense (and all of its 
 components), the Central Intelligence Agency, the National 
 Reconnaissance Office, the Department of Justice (and all of 
 its components), the National Security Council, and the 
 Executive Office of the President.
 (3) Gross violations of internationally recognized human 
 rights.--The term ``gross violations of internationally 
 recognized human rights'' has the meaning given that term in 
 section 502B(d)(1) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 
 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)).

SEC. 4. IDENTIFICATION, REVIEW, AND PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF HUMAN RIGHTS 
 RECORDS REGARDING GUATEMALA AND HONDURAS.

 (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the 
provisions of this Act shall govern the declassification and public 
disclosure of human rights records by agencies.
 (b) Identification of Records.--Not later than 120 days after the 
date of enactment of this Act, each agency shall identify, review, and 
organize all human rights records regarding activities occurring in 
Guatemala and Honduras after 1944 for the purpose of declassifying and 
disclosing the records to the public. Except as provided in section 5, 
all records described in the preceding sentence shall be made available 
to the public not later than 30 days after a review under this section 
is completed.
 (c) Report to Congress.--Not later than 150 days after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the President shall report to Congress regarding 
each agency's compliance with the provisions of this Act.

SEC. 5. GROUNDS FOR POSTPONEMENT OF PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF RECORDS.

 (a) In General.--An agency may postpone public disclosure of a 
human rights record or particular information in a human rights record 
only if the agency determines that there is clear and convincing 
evidence that--
 (1) the threat to the military defense, intelligence 
 operations, or conduct of foreign relations of the United 
 States raised by public disclosure of the human rights record 
 is of such gravity that it outweighs the public interest, and 
 such public disclosure would reveal--
 (A) an intelligence agent whose identity currently 
 requires protection;
 (B) an intelligence source or method--
 (i) which is being utilized, or reasonably 
 expected to be utilized, by the United States 
 Government;
 (ii) which has not been officially 
 disclosed; and
 (iii) the disclosure of which would 
 interfere with the conduct of intelligence 
 activities; or
 (C) any other matter currently relating to the 
 military defense, intelligence operations, or conduct 
 of foreign relations of the United States, the 
 disclosure of which would demonstrably impair the 
 national security of the 
 United States;
 (2) the public disclosure of the human rights record would 
 reveal the name or identity of a living individual who provided 
 confidential information to the United States and would pose a 
 substantial risk of harm to that individual;
 (3) the public disclosure of the human rights record could 
 reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of 
 personal privacy, and that invasion of privacy is so 
 substantial that it outweighs the public interest; or
 (4) the public disclosure of the human rights record would 
 compromise the existence of an understanding of confidentiality 
 currently requiring protection between a Government agent and a 
 cooperating individual or a foreign government, and public 
 disclosure would be so harmful that it outweighs the public 
 interest.
 (b) Special Treatment of Certain Information.--It shall not be 
grounds for postponement of disclosure of a human rights record that an 
individual named in the human rights record was an intelligence asset 
of the United States Government, although the existence of such 
relationship may be withheld if the criteria set forth in subsection 
(a) are met. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term an 
``intelligence asset'' means a covert agent as defined in section 
606(4) of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 426(4)).

SEC. 6. REQUEST FOR HUMAN RIGHTS RECORDS FROM OFFICIAL ENTITIES IN 
 OTHER COUNTRIES.

 In the event that an agency of the United States receives a request 
for human rights records from an entity created by the United Nations, 
the Organization of American States or a similar entity, a national 
truth commission or entity of similar nature, or from the principal 
justice or human rights official of a country that is investigating a 
pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights, 
the agency shall conduct a review of records as described in section 4 
and shall declassify and publicly disclose such records in accordance 
with the standards and procedures set forth in this Act.

to postpone public disclosure of any human rights record.
 (b) Determinations of the Appeals Panel.--
 (1) In general.--The Appeals Panel shall direct that all 
 human rights records be disclosed to the public, unless the 
 Appeals Panel determines that there is clear and convincing 
 evidence that--
 (A) the record is not a human rights record; or
 (B) the human rights record or particular 
 information in the human rights record qualifies for 
 postponement of disclosure pursuant to section 5.
 (2) Treatment in cases of nondisclosure.--If the Appeals 
 Panel concurs with an agency decision to postpone disclosure of 
 a human rights record, the Appeals Panel shall determine, in 
 consultation with the originating agency and consistent with 
the standards set forth in this Act, which, if any, of the alternative 
forms of disclosure described in paragraph (3) shall be made by the 
agency.
 (3) Alternative forms of disclosure.--The forms of 
 disclosure described in this paragraph are as follows:
 (A) Disclosure of any reasonably segregable portion 
 of the human rights record after deletion of the 
 portions described in paragraph (1).
 (B) Disclosure of a record that is a substitute for 
 information which is not disclosed.
 (C) Disclosure of a summary of the information 
 contained in the human rights record.
 (4) Notification of determination.--
 (A) In general.--Upon completion of its review, the 
 Appeals Panel shall notify the head of the agency in 
 control or possession of the human rights record that 
 was the subject of the review of its determination and 
 shall, not later than 14 days after the determination, 
 publish the determination in the Federal Register.

 notify the President of its determination. The notice 
 shall contain a written unclassified justification for 
 its determination, including an explanation of the 
 application of the standards contained in section 5.
 (5) General procedures.--The Appeals Panel shall publish in 
 the Federal Register guidelines regarding its policy and 
 procedures for adjudicating appeals.
 (c) Presidential Authority Over Appeals Panel Determination.--
 (1) Public disclosure or postponement of disclosure.--The 
 President shall have the sole and nondelegable authority to 
 review any determination of the Appeals Panel under this Act, 
 and such review shall be based on the standards set forth in 
 section 5. Not later than 30 days after the Appeals Panel's 
 determination and notification to the agency pursuant to 
 subsection (b)(4), the President shall provide the Appeals 
 Panel with an unclassified written certification specifying the 
 President's decision and stating the reasons for the decision, 
 including in the case of a determination to postpone 
 disclosure, the standards set forth in section 5 which are the 
 basis for the President's determination.
 (2) Record of presidential postponement.--The Appeals Panel 
 shall, upon receipt of the President's determination, publish 
 in the Federal Register a copy of any unclassified written 
 certification, statement, and other materials transmitted by or 
 on behalf of the President with regard to the postponement of 
 disclosure of a human rights record.

shall seek recommendations with respect to such positions from 
nongovernmental human rights organizations.","Human Rights Information Act - Requires certainFederal agencies to identify and organize allhuman rights records regarding activitiesoccurring in Guatemala and Honduras after 1944 forclassification and closure purposes, and tohide them from the public.","This Bill requires federal agencies to identify and organize human rights records regarding activities in Guatemala and Honduras after 1944.

At the start of the war, the French North American colonies had a population of roughly 60,000 European settlers, compared with 2 million in the British North American colonies.

The kilogram-force leads to an alternate, but rarely used unit of mass: the metric slug (sometimes mug or hyl) is that mass that accelerates at 1 m·s−2 when subjected to a force of 1 kgf. The kilogram-force is not a part of the modern SI system, and is generally deprecated; however it still sees use for some purposes as expressing aircraft weight, jet thrust, bicycle spoke tension, torque wrench settings and engine output torque. Other arcane units of force include the sthène, which is equivalent to 1000 N, and the kip, which is equivalent to 1000 lbf.

Question Generation,"Optical mice use an LED and a camera to rapidly
capture images of the surface beneath the mouse.
The infomation from the camera is analyzed by a
DSP (Digital Signal Processor) and used to detect
imperfections in the underlying surface and
determine motion. Some materials, such as glass,
mirrors or other very shiny, uniform surfaces
interfere with the ability of the DSP to
accurately analyze the surface beneath the mouse.
\nSince glass is transparent and very uniform, the
mouse is unable to pick up enough imperfections in
the underlying surface to determine motion.
Mirrored surfaces are also a problem, since they
constantly reflect back the same image, causing
the DSP not to recognize motion properly. When the

The authors analyzed 271 cases of ventricular fibrillation managed by EMT-Ds working without paramedic back-up. Of 111 patients initially converted to organized rhythms, 19 (17%) refibrillated, 11 (58%) of whom were reconverted to perfusing rhythms, including nine of 11 (82%) who had spontaneous pulses prior to refibrillation. Among patients initially converted to organized rhythms, hospital admission rates were lower for patients who refibrillated than for patients who did not(53% versus 76%, P = NS), although discharge rates were virtually identical (37% and 35%, respectively). Scene-to-hospital transport times were not predictively associated with either the frequency of refibrillation or patient outcome. Defibrillation-trained EMTs can effectively manage refibrillation with additional shocks and are not at a significant disadvantage when paramedic back-up is not available.",Refibrillation managed by EMT-Ds,The abstract is about refibrillation and it is also mentioned in the abstract that it is managed by EMT-Ds. So it is an apt title.,"Abstract: As the use of helicopters for air transport of critically ill patients increases, the availability of monitoring devices for physiological parameters during flight becomes important. It has long been known that arterial PO2 (PaO2) decreases during unsupplemented, non- pressurized flight. In this study, the authors examined the use of the transconjunctival oxygen (cjO2) monitor for assessing the adequacy of arterial oxygenation during helicopter flight in four healthy volunteers. Arterial PaO2 as measured by conventional blood gas analysis was compared with cjO2 at ground level, 5,000 feet, and 10,000 feet altitude. Mean PaO2 dropped significantly from 93.5 to 81.5 to 58.5 mm Hg, respectively (P less than 0.001, analysis of variance with repeated measures). Mean cjO2 also decreased significantly from 63.8 to 52.0 to 34.8 mm Hg, respectively (P less than 0.001, analysis of variance with repeated measures). Within individual subjects, cjO2 was an accurate predictor of PaO2 (P less than 0.001, multiple regression analysis). The relationship between cjO2 and PaO2 was linear with a regression coefficient of 1.147. The authors conclude that the transconjunctival O2 monitor may be useful for monitoring the adequacy of arterial oxygenation during helicopter flight in hemodynamically stable patients. The results of study also support the use of supplemental oxygen in all patients subjected to helicopter transport.",Nasogastric intubation,The title 'Nasogastric intubation' is completely out of the given abstract. So not an apt title. Title can be with helicopter transportation and transconjunctival oxygen.

Story Composition,"Fact1: Ning returns to home village, Fact2: home village has fallen on desperate times, Fact3: rebel sisters and Moon After discover Elder Chu's pendant short skirmish, Fact4: father is being transported to place of execution, Fact5: Imperial High Monk Before arrives with entourage long","Following the events of the first film, Ning (Leslie Cheung) parts ways with the Taoist Yin (Wu Ma) and returns to his home village, which has since fallen on desperate times. Fleeing from cannibals, Ning winds up being imprisoned. Sharing a cell with Elder Chu, a renowned scholar, Ning spends apparent months languishing in prison. On the day of Ning's execution, the scholar reveals that he has dug out an escape tunnel. He gives Ning one of his books and a pendant, and sends Ning through the tunnel. Ning obliviously steals the horse of Autumn (Jacky Cheung), a Taoist sectarian. When Ning stops for the night in an abandoned villa, Autumn catches up and the two sort out the misunderstanding. But in the middle of the night, rebel soldiers attack the two visitors. After a short skirmish, the rebel sisters Windy (Joey Wong) and Moon (Michelle Reis) discover Elder Chu's pendant. While Ning mistakes Windy for his love Siu Sin, whom she resembles, the rebels mistake Ning for the Elder Chu. The sisters explain that their father, Lord Fu (Lau Siu-Ming), was framed for a crime and is now being transported to the place of his execution. The rebels' mission is to free him. They set off and leave Ning and Autumn at the villa. The next night, the two discover that the villa actually is haunted by a demon. Autumn manages to injure it, but it flees. He gives pursuit, but without success. He emerges at daybreak on a dirt road, causing an altercation with an imperial convoy led by Fu (Waise Lee). Fu and Autumn battle to a stalemate, and then go their separate ways. Unbeknownst to Autumn, the convoy is the one carrying the sisters' father. Having failed to catch the convoy earlier, the rebels return to the haunted villa, waiting to ambush the convoy there. As the convoy enters, however, the demon returns as well. Maneuvering Fu into fighting the demon, the rebels are able to rescue the sisters' father. Before long, however, the Imperial High Monk arrives with his entourage. He incapacitates the rebels with a spell, which Autumn recognizes as an evil chant. Ning and Windy escape to seek the help of Yin, while Lord Fu, Autumn and Moon are captured by the monk. The captives are brought back to the High Monk's palace. Now suspicious, Fu enters the palace only to find the hollow corpses of the entire royal court inside. Recognizing that the monk is in reality a demon, Fu frees the captives and fights valiantly by himself to allow them time to recover. Lacking spiritual magic, however, Fu is not able to overcome the demon and is destroyed. Just then, Yin and the others arrive. The demon is forced to reveal its true form, a gigantic thousand-year-old centipede. Yin and Autumn are swallowed by the creature, and they separate their souls from their bodies in order to destroy it from the inside. Autumn, however, is not able to return to his body, and his soul floats away. The next day is the marriage of Windy to the Ma family. Ning runs down from his inn to the main street and tells Moon that he wishes Windy a long, happy marriage before leaving. In the desert, as Yin and Ning are about to continue their journey, they see two women approach on horseback, which happen to be Windy and Moon. Windy has escaped from her wedding and decides to leave with Ning",All the given five facts are present in the generated story in the same order that they appear in the input.,"Fact1: Alby's is challenged mentally, Fact2: loving nature attracts Alice, Fact3: relations become strained between brother and sister, Fact4: Sophia prepare thesis on orphanages, Fact5: movie is based on Hollywood Benny & Joon starring Johnny Depp Aidan Quinn Mary Stuart Masterson and Julianne Moore","Jed Clampett (Jim Varney), a hillsman of humble station, accidentally discovers oil on his land while shooting at a rabbit. Ozark Mountain Oil, interested in purchasing his land, offers him $1 billion for the property. Unsure of what to do, Jed consults his cousin, Pearl Bodine (Linda Carlson), during a family dinner. Pearl suggests a change of scenery for Jed's daughter, Elly May (Erika Eleniak), would be a good thing. Having made up his mind and accepted the money, Jed, his daughter, his mother-in-law Granny (Cloris Leachman), and his nephew, Jethro (Diedrich Bader), Pearl's son, load up Jethro's old, dilapidated truck with their possessions and move to Beverly Hills, California. Milburn Drysdale (Dabney Coleman), the CEO of the Commerce Bank of Beverly Hills (where Jed's money is stored), sends out his secretary/assistant, Miss Jane Hathaway (Lily Tomlin) to meet the Clampetts at their new estate. Miss Jane calls the Beverly Hills Police after the Clampetts arrive, mistaking them for burglars. Upon learning of Miss Jane's mistake at the police station, Mr. Drysdale briefly fires her. But seeing that Jed insists that he still wants her to watch over his affairs, Mr. Drysdale rehires her. The Clampetts settle into their new surroundings. Mr. Drysdale pushes his reluctant son, Morgan Drysdale (Kevin Connolly), into befriending Elly May, to whom he eventually develops an attraction. Miss Jane is also smitten by Jethro, who seems ignorant of her affections. Jed requests Miss Jane's assistance in helping him search for someone who will help turn Elly May into a lady.

She poses as a French etiquette teacher, Laurette Voleur, and asks for work. ""Laurette"" feigns romantic interest in Jed, which eventually causes him to propose marriage to her. Shortly before the wedding, Granny hears Laura and Woodrow talking about the scam. Granny reveals herself to the pair and threatens to expose their scam to Jed, and the impending wedding will be off. But before she can, they capture her, restrain her, and have her institutionalized at the Los Viejos Nursing Home so she cannot contact Jed.

Summarization,"Mixed precision training (MPT) is becoming a practical technique to improve the speed and energy efficiency of training deep neural networks by leveraging the fast hardware support for IEEE half-precision floating point that is available in existing GPUs. MPT is typically used in combination with a technique called loss scaling, that works by scaling up the loss value up before the start of backpropagation in order to minimize the impact of numerical underflow on training. Unfortunately, existing methods make this loss scale value a hyperparameter that needs to be tuned per-model, and a single scale cannot be adapted to different layers at different training stages. We introduce a loss scaling-based training method called adaptive loss scaling that makes MPT easier and more practical to use, by removing the need to tune a model-specific loss scale hyperparameter. We achieve this by introducing layer-wise loss scale values which are automatically computed during training to deal with underflow more effectively than existing methods. We present experimental results on a variety of networks and tasks that show our approach can shorten the time to convergence and improve accuracy, compared with using the existing state-of-the-art MPT and single-precision floating point.",We devise adaptive loss scaling to improve mixed precision training that surpass the state-of-the-art results.,"The abstract focusses on designing an adaptive loss scaling method, hence the generated output is correct.","Mixed precision training (MPT) is becoming a practical technique to improve the speed and energy efficiency of training deep neural networks by leveraging the fast hardware support for IEEE half-precision floating point that is available in existing GPUs.

It is an important step towards understanding the meaning of a natural language. There exists SRL systems for well-studied languages like English, Chinese or Japanese but there is not any such system for the Vietnamese language. In this paper, we present the first SRL system for Vietnamese with encouraging accuracy. We first demonstrate that a simple application of SRL techniques developed for English could not give a good accuracy for Vietnamese. We then introduce a new algorithm for extracting candidate syntactic constituents, which is much more accurate than the common node-mapping algorithm usually used in the identification step.

Answerability Classification,"Question: When did the operation during which the 704th dropped supplies to allied troops near Nijmegen begin? Passage: The group was occasionally diverted from strategic missions to carry out air support and interdiction missions. It supported Operation Overlord, the invasion of Normandy by attacking transportation targets, including bridges, along with airfields and strong points in France. On D Day, the squadron and the rest of the 446th Group led the first heavy bomber mission of the day. The 446th aided ground forces at Caen and Saint-Lô during July by hitting bridges, gun batteries, and enemy troops. During Operation Market Garden, the attempt to seize a bridgehead across the Rhine in the Netherlands, the 704th dropped supplies to allied troops near Nijmegen. It struck lines of communications during the Battle of the Bulge. During Operation Varsity in March 1945, it supplied ground and airborne troops near Wesel.

Question Generation,"CONTEXT: Milk won't help you - it's mostly water, and gluten develops from flour (more accurately, specific proteins in flour) and water.The way to reduce gluten development is to incorporate more fat into the batter. Lipids are hydrophobic and will prevent further hydration of the glutenin.Using a lower-protein flour will also help. If you're not already using cake flour, the reason it's called cake flour is because of the lower protein content.That being said, have you actually tried leaving the batter coarse? Just because the batter is lumpy does not mean that the cake will have big lumps. The entire mixture is wet, so unless you leave huge lumps of dry flour in the batter, you won't end up with a lumpy cake.

Explanation,"Paragraph: ""Although the story didn’t cite the cost of appendectomy – emergency or urgent surgery – and we wish it had, we nonetheless will give it a satisfactory score because it at least cited what the editorial writer wrote, """"A secondary benefit is the savings to the hospital generated by minimizing staff and anesthesiologist presence late in the evening and during the wee hours of the morning."""" As with our harms score above, although the story didn’t give absolute numbers, in this case we think it was sufficient for it to report that """"The scientists found no significant difference among the groups in the patients’ condition 30 days after surgery or in the length of their operation or hospital stay."""" Although the story didn’t give absolute numbers, in this case we think it was sufficient for it to report that """"The scientists found no significant difference among the groups in the patients’ condition 30 days after surgery or in the length of their operation or hospital stay."""" Despite running less than 300 words, this story did an adequate job in explaining the quality of the evidence, including pointing out limitations. No disease-mongering here. The story meets the bare minimum requirement for this criterion in that it at least cited what an editorial stated. The focus of the story was on a study comparing emergency appendectomy with surgery done up to 12 hours later or beyond. This is the whole focus of the story – and one we applaud – when it begins:  """"Appendectomy is the most common emergency surgery in the world, but it doesn’t have to be."""" There were no claims made about the novelty of this research, and we may have wished for a bit more context on this. Nonetheless, the potential for guiding future care decisions was made clear. Not applicable. Given that the story only pulled excerpts from the journal article and the accompanying editorial, and didn’t include any fresh quotes from interviews, we can’t be sure of the extent to which it may have been influenced by a news release."". Claim: Some appendicitis cases may not require ’emergency’ surgery","We really don’t understand why only a handful of mainstream news organizations reported this story. (At least in what we found.) The most common emergency surgery in the world. Rushing to emergency surgery may not carry any benefit. Waiting a few hours may be safer and less expensive. Why is that not a story? We applaud USA Today for finding time and space – and clearly it didn’t need to free up much space to do a good job telling the story. The story explains that as many as 300,0 appendectomies are done each year in the US. That figure alone explains why this is an important study to report.",The output is an analysis of the claim while considering the paragraph as a reference. The output highlights the key features presented in the paragraph and explains the claim accordingly.,"Paragraph: The story does discuss costs,but the framing is problematic. The story,based on a conversation with one source,the study’s lead investigator,says,“It’s difficult at this point to predict costs. However,he expects costs will not approach those for Provenge,the pricey treatment vaccine for prostate cancer approved by the FDA in 2010. Provenge costs $93,0 for the one-month,three- dose treatment. Medicare covers it.” This tells readers that,no matter what the drug costs,Medicare likely will cover it. We appreciate the effort to bring cost information into the story,but this type of information is misleading. The story does explain that only one patient remains cancer free following the study. It then details how for most of the patients cancer continued to progress after 2 months. It says that the median overall survival in both the breast cancer and ovarian cancer patients was less than 16 months. But the story is framed in such a way to highlight the one potentially positive outcome of the study and to downplay the negative. We read more sooner about the one patient who may have responded well to the vaccine than we do about the 25 other patients who did not. The story mentions side effects in a satisfactory way. Technically,the story provides readers with much of the information they would need to assess the validity of the study,but it comes out in bits and pieces. For example,we only find out near the end of the story that “The woman,who remains disease-free,had a previous treatment with a different treatment vaccine. ‘That might have primed her immune system,’ Gulley speculates. She also had only one regimen of chemotherapy,perhaps keeping her immune system stronger.” This casts much doubt on the study’s design,and it would have been nice to have seen some outside expertise brought in to either discuss those design problems or to torpedo the story altogether. Again,the story deserves high marks for being very specific in the lead and throughout the story. It says,that the vaccine is “for breast and ovarian cancer that has spread to other parts of the body” in the lead and later details the particular circumstances of the study cohort. It says,“The patients had already undergone a variety of treatments but the cancer was progressing. Twenty one of the 26 had undergone three or more chemotherapy regimens.” This is the root of the story’s main shortcoming. Almost all of the information in the story comes from one source:Dr. James Gulley,who oversaw the study. Gulley is quite enthusiastic about this vaccine,despite the evidence,and the story needed more perspectives to put this vaccine into a broader context. At the very end,there are a few comments from Dr. Vincent K. Tuohy,who also is working on a breast cancer vaccine. Because of his competing research,he seems to have a conflict,but even putting that aside,his comments were not used to their best effect. There was no comparison in the story to existing alternatives. The median survival,for example,is presented without the context of how long these patients might have lived had they been undergoing standard chemotherapy and radiation treatments. We give high marks to the story for saying right in the lead that the findings are from “a preliminary study in 26 patients.” That tells readers both that the findings need to be interpreted with caution and that the treatment is not available to most people. The concept of vaccines for breast/ovarian cancer is indeed novel,and the story acknowledges that other vaccines are being studied. The story does not rely on a news release. Claim: Study: Vaccine for Breast, Ovarian Cancer Has Potential","While the story does many things well,the overall framing of the story is that the vaccine “shows promise,” when the evidence actually points in the other direction. As the evidence is in other direction, it can be said that Vaccine is ineffective for Breast and Ovarian Cancer.","The output contradicts the Claim and does not keep in mind the overall support of the paragraph in support of the vaccine, we can consider this output as incorrect and incoherent to the idea emphasized and supported by the paragraph."

M: When we think of energy or fuel for our homes and cars, we think of petroleum, a fossil fuel processed from oil removed from the ground, of which there is a limited supply. But alternative fuels can be many things. Wind, sun and water can all be used to create fuel. W: Is the threat of running out of petroleum real? M: It has taken thousands of years to create the natural stores of petroleum we have available at a much faster rate than it is being produced over time. The real controversy surrounding the amount of petroleum we have is how much we need to keep in reserve for future use. Most experts agree that by around 2025, the amount of petroleum we use will reach a peak. Then production and availability will begin to seriously decline. This is not to say there will be no petroleum at this point. But it'll become very difficult and therefore expensive to extract. W: Is that the most important reason to develop alternative fuel and energy sources? M: There are two very clear reasons to do so. One is that whether we have 60 or 600 years of fossil fuels left, we have to find other fuel sources eventually. So the sooner we start, the better off we will be. The other big argument is that when long time, which leads to some long-term negative effects, like global warming and the greenhouse effect., Question: What do most experts agree on according to the man?

 context: Consultant pharmacy practice focuses more on medication regimen review (i.e. cognitive services) than on actual dispensing of drugs. Consultant pharmacists most typically work in nursing homes, but are increasingly branching into other institutions and non-institutional settings. Traditionally consultant pharmacists were usually independent business owners, though in the United States many now work for several large pharmacy management companies (primarily Omnicare, Kindred Healthcare and PharMerica). This trend may be gradually reversing as consultant pharmacists begin to work directly with patients, primarily because many elderly people are now taking numerous medications but continue to live outside of institutional settings.

The opener came on, and we danced our butts off to the banjoes and mandolins that were playing on-stage. We were so happy to be there. That's when the sunset started. It was so beautiful. The sky was a pastel pink and was beautiful to watch. That's when Phil Lesh came on, and I just about died. It was the happiest moment of my life, seeing him after almost a decade of not seeing him. I was so happy to be there, with my friends and my love. There was nothing that could top that night. We drove home to a sky full of stars and stopped at an overlook to look up at them.

Fact Verification,"Paragraph: While the financial costs of screening mammography&!1-positive recalls&biopsies were not included in the study,readers would benefit from being reminded that recall mammography&biopsies increase patient financial costs.This article leads with valuable information for all women over age 40 by stating “Getting screening mammograms every two years instead of annually reduces the chance of a!1 alarm,a new study shows.” Unfortunately the writer doesn’t quantify or elaborate adequately on that reduction.Instead,the writer later focuses on how women undergoing screening mammography shouldn’t be anxious if they experience a recall because over half of women who have screening mammograms for 10 years will be recalled.Readers would have been better served if the writer had emphasized the significant reduction in both recall mammograms&!1-positive biopsies in women who are screened every two years rather than annually.Part of the continuing controversy over screening mammography focuses on annual versus biennial screening.Because this study showed a significant reduction in the percentage of those recalled&needing biopsies among women who are screened every other year,with no statistically significant increase in late-stage diagnosis of breast cancer,the article should have emphasized those important findings.The piece states that the researchers noted that “…!1 positive recalls may cause inconvenience&anxiety and biopsies can cause pain and scarring.” This article fails to include several important facts about the study.1)This is a prospective cohort study of women screened between 1994-2006.2)Most of the mammograms were film rather than digital.3)Few women underwent screening for the entire 10 year period.4)Screening mammography recall rates are influenced by the skill of the radiologists who read the mammograms.There was no disease mongering.No independent experts were quoted.The story did an adequate job comparing – at a very high level – annual screening versus biennial screening.Screening mammography is widely available throughout the United States.The study did not examine a new procedure.There’s no evidence that the story relied solely on a news release. 
Claim: Annual Mammograms May Have More False-Positives",1,"This article reports on the results of a study of nearly 170,0 women who had screening mammograms beginning between age 40-59.The study found that over ten years of screening mammograms,over half of the women will experience a!1-positive recall for additional mammography.In addition,7%-9%of the women will have a biopsy for a suspicious lump which is not cancerous.Both of those percentages decrease if the woman is screened every other year rather than every year.Even with biennial mammography,41%of women will experience a recall over 10 years of mammography.The study’s Principal Investigator emphasized that “in most cases,a recall doesn’t mean you have cancer.” She hoped this knowledge would reduce the anxiety of women who are recalled.The story never explained the size of the decrease in the number of!1 positives between annual(61.3%) and biennial screening(41.6%).Our first two reviewers were a researcher who specializes in health decisions and a breast cancer survivor trained in evidence by the Natiional Breast Cancer Coalition’s Project LEAD.This study is valuable because it helps to quantify and compare the harms of annual and biennial screening,specifically the number of!1 positives and the number of unnecessary biopsies.Prior to this study,estimates of!1 positive screening mammography rates varied widely.The critical question is whether you can do less frequent screening,subject women to fewer harms and get similar results in terms of detection of “early stage” cancer.This study’s data seems to suggest that answer is yes.","Paragraph: The story does discuss costs,but the framing is problematic. The story,based on a conversation with one source,the study’s lead investigator,says,“It’s difficult at this point to predict costs. However,he expects costs will not approach those for Provenge,the pricey treatment vaccine for prostate cancer approved by the FDA in 2010. Provenge costs $93,0 for the one-month,three- dose treatment. Medicare covers it.” This tells readers that,no matter what the drug costs,Medicare likely will cover it. We appreciate the effort to bring cost information into the story,but this type of information is misleading. The story does explain that only one patient remains cancer free following the study. It then details how for most of the patients cancer continued to progress after 2 months. It says that the median overall survival in both the breast cancer and ovarian cancer patients was less than 16 months. But the story is framed in such a way to highlight the one potentially positive outcome of the study and to downplay the negative. We read more sooner about the one patient who may have responded well to the vaccine than we do about the 25 other patients who did not. The story mentions side effects in a satisfactory way. Technically,the story provides readers with much of the information they would need to assess the validity of the study,but it comes out in bits and pieces. For example,we only find out near the end of the story that “The woman,who remains disease-free,had a previous treatment with a different treatment vaccine. ‘That might have primed her immune system,’ Gulley speculates. She also had only one regimen of chemotherapy,perhaps keeping her immune system stronger.” This casts much doubt on the study’s design,and it would have been nice to have seen some outside expertise brought in to either discuss those design problems or to torpedo the story altogether. Again,the story deserves high marks for being very specific in the lead and throughout the story. It says,that the vaccine is “for breast and ovarian cancer that has spread to other parts of the body” in the lead and later details the particular circumstances of the study cohort. It says,“The patients had already undergone a variety of treatments but the cancer was progressing. Twenty one of the 26 had undergone three or more chemotherapy regimens.” This is the root of the story’s main shortcoming. Almost all of the information in the story comes from one source:Dr. James Gulley,who oversaw the study. Gulley is quite enthusiastic about this vaccine,despite the evidence,and the story needed more perspectives to put this vaccine into a broader context. At the very end,there are a few comments from Dr. Vincent K. Tuohy,who also is working on a breast cancer vaccine. Because of his competing research,he seems to have a conflict,but even putting that aside,his comments were not used to their best effect. There was no comparison in the story to existing alternatives. The median survival,for example,is presented without the context of how long these patients might have lived had they been undergoing standard chemotherapy and radiation treatments. We give high marks to the story for saying right in the lead that the findings are from “a preliminary study in 26 patients.” That tells readers both that the findings need to be interpreted with caution and that the treatment is not available to most people. The concept of vaccines for breast/ovarian cancer is indeed novel,and the story acknowledges that other vaccines are being studied. The story does not rely on a news release. 
Claim: Study: Vaccine for Breast, Ovarian Cancer Has Potential",0,"While the story does many things well,the overall framing of the story is that the vaccine “shows promise,” when the evidence actually points in the other direction.Because only one patient in the study remains cancer free and because that patient may very well have benefited from an earlier cancer vaccine and other complicating factors,we question the decision to write this story in the first place.Right now,there more than 10,0 cancer-related clinical trials recruiting patients.Cancer has foiled scientists repeatedly with treatments that initially seemed promising in the laboratory or in a very small group of people and later proved unworkable on a larger scale.It’s a difficult task — but a crucial one — for reporters to ask tough questions of the evidence and a wide range of sources before deciding whether one of these thousands of experimental treatment options merits coverage. This shows that the claim is True and the output is incorrect."

Title Generation,"But Eluned Morgan conceded that it would be ""difficult for us to stop"" from a legal point of view. Her comments were criticised by a Labour AM. Alun Davies said threatening legal action ""sounds like the last breath before you're thrown out of the pub"". Mr Davies said he was not convinced the Welsh Government would ""have a leg to stand on"" in trying to shape international trade deals after Brexit. Following Donald Trump's comments during last week's trade visit that the NHS would be ""on the table"" in any future trade talks between the UK and the USA, Eluned Morgan said there was ""absolutely no prospect whatsoever of us allowing the Welsh NHS to be part of any negotiation."" The US President then rowed back on his initial comments following criticism from a number of MPs. Asked about her response to President Trump's remarks as she gave evidence to the Assembly's Brexit committee on Monday, Ms Morgan said ""legally, it would be difficult for us to stop because we don't have a veto over trade"". ""Politically, I think it's extremely unlikely to happen,"" the international relations and the Welsh language minister said. ""They [the UK Government] should not be concluding any trade agreements without consulting us where we have the power."" Ms Morgan explained that UK and Welsh government officials are working on an agreement or 'concordat' for how future trade deals are negotiated. During a robust exchange, the Labour AM Alun Davies said: ""I want something which is in law to which I can hold you to account and which colleagues in Westminster can hold the UK Government to account. ""The argument we'll make life difficult for them, it sounds alright on the street, but it's not the reality of intergovernmental relations."" ""The United Kingdom has to find a way of functioning. ""At the moment, your answers aren't giving me any confidence that there is that structure in place because, if the Welsh Government's argument is, 'we'll see you in court', it's not a very impressive argument either for the continuation of the structure of United Kingdom as a state or the commitment of the government within the United Kingdom to actually work together,"" he added. Responding to the criticism, Ms Morgan said: ""Is the current intergovernmental structure adequate? ""Absolutely not... and it's not just in relation to trade, it's in relation to almost every aspect of government policy. So, that infrastructure needs to be built.""",NHS Wales: Court action if trade deals affect service?,The output phrase is the appropriate title for the given text and it highlights the essence of the passage.,"Supporters followed on the radio and TV as Harrogate Town won the National League play-off final at Wembley. The result has been described as a ""superb lift"" for the spa town. Work to rip up the club's artificial pitch and replace it with grass, in keeping with league regulations, is expected to start later on Monday. Fan Brody Pattison joked that he wanted some of the artificial pitch in his back garden as a souvenir. He said: ""I can't thank the players enough, they're all heroes for this town, they're going to go down in history. ""We've come so far as a club in the last three or four years, we're a small town full of teashops and we're in the Football League."" Another Sulphurites supporter, Jack Wilkinson, said he woke up on Monday with a bottle of champagne and a huge sign saying ""we're going to Wembley"". He said: ""As soon as they scored the first goal, that's when the tears started and they didn't stop until full-time, I'm a grown adult crying over a football match. ""It makes the early mornings going to Dover, Yeovil, Torquay all worth it."" The Sulphurites also won the praise of what is possibly Harrogate's most famous institution, Bettys tearoom. A spokeswoman said: ""We've the kettle on and Fat Rascals (a kind of scone) in the oven. We're delighted to raise a toast to Simon Weaver and the winning Harrogate team."" Harrogate businessman Mark Noble was lucky enough to attend the game as a guest of the club. He said: ""The lads were all so proud, the support they've had all season was with them yesterday, the flags were up. ""Yesterday was a large key opening a large door, next season we're in that room and hopefully when Covid is over, all the supporters will all be there following the team."" Simon Cotton, who runs hotels and pubs in and around the town, said promotion was a ""superb lift"" for Harrogate after ""so many months of lockdown blues"". He said: ""Harrogate relies on visitor tourism and if more fans are travelling to see their teams then they're potentially going to stay in hotels in the town, go for a drink in the bars, have something to eat in the restaurants and buy something in the shops."" There have been calls for an open-top bus parade, although coronavirus restrictions mean this is unlikely. Harrogate Borough mayor Stuart Martin said: ""We've got to try and think of how best we can celebrate - under normal circumstances, wouldn't it have been nice to have a civic reception for them? - but there's no way we can do that under the current climate, it's just not feasible."" He said promotion was ""going to bring a real buzz to the town, to the district, to the county"" and would encourage more youngsters to get involved in sport. Lindsey Whitton, captain of Harrogate Town's women's team, said she hoped the club's recent success would inspire more girls to start playing football. She said: ""It's amazing, the profile of the club has just risen so much within 24 hours, not only for the men's team but it's going to have a massive impact on the women's team, the player development centre, the academy.""

Question Generation,"Article: Homework can put you in a badmood , and that might actually be a good thing. Researchers from the University of Plymouth in England doubted whether mood might affect the way kids learn. To find out the answer, they did two experiments with children. The first experiment tested 30 kids. Someshapes were hidden inside a different, larger picture. The kids had to find the small shapes while sitting in a room with either cheerful or sad music playing in the background. To test their mood, the scientists asked the kids to point to one of five faces, from happy to sad. Children who listened to cheerful music tended to point to the smiley faces while the others pointed to the unhappy ones. The researchers found that sad kids took at least a second less to find the small shapes. They also found an average of three or four more shapes. In the second experiment, 61 children watched one of two scenes from a film. One scene was happy, and the other was sad. Just like in the first experiment, kids who saw the sad scene acted better compared to the others. The researchers guessed that feeling down makes people more likely to focus on a problem or difficult situation. Not all scientists agree with them, however. Other studies argued that maybe, that cheerful music in the first experiment distracted kids from finding shapes. While scientists work on finding out the answers, it still might be wise to choose when to do your tasks according to your mood. After eating a delicious ice cream, for example, write an essay.

Text Matching,"Abstract: Some patients converted from ventricular fibrillation to organized rhythms by defibrillation-trained ambulance technicians (EMT-Ds) will refibrillate before hospital arrival. The authors analyzed 271 cases of ventricular fibrillation managed by EMT-Ds working without paramedic back-up. Of 111 patients initially converted to organized rhythms, 19 (17%) refibrillated, 11 (58%) of whom were reconverted to perfusing rhythms, including nine of 11 (82%) who had spontaneous pulses prior to refibrillation. Among patients initially converted to organized rhythms, hospital admission rates were lower for patients who refibrillated than for patients who did not(53% versus 76%, P = NS), although discharge rates were virtually identical (37% and 35%, respectively). Scene-to-hospital transport times were not predictively associated with either the frequency of refibrillation or patient outcome. Defibrillation-trained EMTs can effectively manage refibrillation with additional shocks and are not at a significant disadvantage when paramedic back-up is not available.

It has long been known that arterial PO2 (PaO2) decreases during unsupplemented, non- pressurized flight. In this study, the authors examined the use of the transconjunctival oxygen (cjO2) monitor for assessing the adequacy of arterial oxygenation during helicopter flight in four healthy volunteers. Arterial PaO2 as measured by conventional blood gas analysis was compared with cjO2 at ground level, 5,000 feet, and 10,000 feet altitude. Mean PaO2 dropped significantly from 93.5 to 81.5 to 58.5 mm Hg, respectively (P less than 0.001, analysis of variance with repeated measures). Mean cjO2 also decreased significantly from 63.8 to 52.0 to 34.8 mm Hg, respectively (P less than 0.001, analysis of variance with repeated measures). Within individual subjects, cjO2 was an accurate predictor of PaO2 (P less than 0.001, multiple regression analysis). The relationship between cjO2 and PaO2 was linear with a regression coefficient of 1.147. The authors conclude that the transconjunctival O2 monitor may be useful for monitoring the adequacy of arterial oxygenation during helicopter flight in hemodynamically stable patients. The results of study also support the use of supplemental oxygen in all patients subjected to helicopter transport. 
 Which is the apt title for the abstract? option1: Nasogastric intubation. option2: Transconjunctival oxygen monitoring as a predictor of hypoxemia during helicopter transport.",Nasogastric intubation,The title 'Nasogastric intubation' is completely out of the given abstract.

McDonald's and Subway are examples of a franchise. The small business owner can leverage a strong brand name and purchasing power of the larger company while keeping their own investment affordable. However, some franchisees conclude that they suffer the ""worst of both worlds"" feeling they are too restricted by corporate mandates and lack true independence. It is an assumption that small business are just franchisees, but the truth is many franchisers are also small businesses, Although considered to be a successful way of doing business, literature has proved that there is a high failure rate in franchising as well, especially in UK, where research indicates that out of 1658 franchising companies operating in 1984, only 601 remained in 1998, a mere 36%.

Both parents know this. What has lead me to ask this question is this mornings reaction from parent B.

This morning parent b offered to make me breakfast, I responded how I always do: that’s very kind but I’m happy to come make it myself. Parent b said it was no trouble. I accepted. Two slices of toast came and apu I check the toast for signs of mould. First piece had no issues, I ate it. Second piece however had something green growing on the edge. I cut this bit off but I couldn’t shake in my head that the whole piece must be contaminated and so I took the toast back and apologised that I couldn’t eat it cos of the mould and we checked the date on the bread and it said the 30th December. Nearly a week past its best before. Parent b apologised and we threw it away. No drama.

Nearly identical situation occurred about 6 months ago with parent a. Parent a offered to make me a toasted sandwich. I said that would be very kind but I was happy to make it myself. Parent a said it was no problem, I accepted. When the sandwich came I checked the bread for mould and found green and white stuff growing down one side of the bread. I take it back to the kitchen and explain that it has mould and I’m sorry but I can’t eat it. I will make myself something else. Parent a goes ballistic. I’m “ungrateful and don’t trust them and did I really think they’d feed me mould?” I pointed out the mould- clearly visible. “Well someone must’ve not sealed the bread package properly (ie me) and that’s how it got mouldy.” I asked if parent a had checked the date and that just seemed to escalate their reaction. They stormed out screaming and crying. I checked the bread date and it was 2 or 3 days past the best before.

Summarization,"Our 'impartial' broadcasters have become mouthpieces of the elite. When people say they have no politics, it means that their politics aligns with the status quo . None of us are unbiased , none removed from the question of power . We are social creatures who absorb the outlook and opinions of those with whom we associate, and unconciously echo them . Objectivity is impossible . The illusion of neutrality is one of the reasons for the rotten state of journalism, as those who might have been expected to hold power to account drift thoughtlessly into its arms . But until I came across the scandal currently erupting in Canada, I hadn't understood just how quickly standards are falling . In 2013 reporters at CBC, Canada's equivalent of the BBC, broke a major story . They discovered that RBC - Royal Bank of Canada - had done something cruel and unusual even by banking standards . It was obliging junior staff to train a group of temporary foreign workers , who would then be given the staff's jobs . Just after the first report was aired, according to the website Canadaland, something odd happened : journalists preparing to expand on the investigation were summoned to a conference call with Amanda Lang, CBC's senior business correspondent and a star presenter . The reporters she spoke to say she repeatedly attempted to scuttle the story, dismissing it as trivial and dull . They were astonished . But not half as astonished as when they discovered the following, unpublished facts . First ,  that Lang had spoken at a series of events run or sponsored by RBC  - for which she appears, on one occasion, to have been paid around 15,000 Canadian dollars . Second , that she was booked to speak at an event sponsored by the outsourcing company the bank had hired to implement the cruel practice exposed by her colleagues . Third , that her partner is a board member at RBC . Lang then interviewed the bank's chief executive on her own show . When he dismissed the story as unfair and misleading , she did not challenge him . That evening she uncritically repeated his talking points on CBC's main current affairs programme . Her interests, again, were not revealed . Then she wrote a comment article for the Globe and Mail newspaper suggesting that her colleagues' story arose from an outdated suspicion of business, was dangerous to Canada's interests, and was nothing but ""a sideshow"" . Here's what she said about the bank's employment practices:""It's called capitalism, and it isn't a dirty word."" Canadaland, which exposed Lang's conflicts last week, found that other journalists at the broadcaster were furious, but too frightened to speak on the record . But after CBC tried to dismiss the scandal as ""half-truths based on anonymous sources"" , Kathy Tomlinson, the reporter who had broken the story about the bank, bravely spoke publicly to the website . The following morning, staff in her office arrived to find this message spelt out in magnets on their fridge:""Jesse Brown snitches get stitches"" . Jesse Brown is Canadaland's founder . CBC refused to answer my questions , and I have not had a response from Lang . It amazes me that she remains employed by CBC , which has so far done nothing but bluster and berate its critics . This is grotesque . But it's symptomatic of a much wider problem in journalism : those who are supposed to scrutinise the financial and political elite are embedded within it . Many belong to a service-sector aristocracy, wedded metaphorically (sometimes literally) to finance . Often unwittingly, they amplify the voices of the elite, while muffling those raised against it . A study by academics at the Cardiff School of Journalism examined the BBC Today programme's reporting of the bank bailouts in 2008 . It discovered that the contributors it chose were ""almost completely dominated by stockbrokers, investment bankers, hedge fund managers and other City voices . Civil society voices or commentators who questioned the benefits of having such a large finance sector were almost completely absent from coverage."" The financiers who had caused the crisis were asked to interpret it . The same goes for discussions about the deficit and the perceived need for austerity . The debate has been dominated by political and economic elites , while alternative voices - arguing that the crisis has been exaggerated, or that instead of cuts, the government should respond with Keynesian spending programmes or taxes on financial transactions, wealth or land- have scarcely been heard . Those priorities have changed your life : the BBC helped to shape the political consensus under which so many are now suffering . The BBC's business reporting breaks its editorial guidelines every day by failing to provide alternative viewpoints . Every weekday morning, the Today programme grovels to business leaders for 10 minutes . It might occasionally challenge them on the value or viability of their companies, but hardly ever on their ethics . Corporate critics are shut out of its business coverage - and almost all the rest . On BBC News at Six, the Cardiff researchers found, business representatives outnumbered trade union representatives by 19 to one . ""The BBC tends to reproduce a Conservative, Eurosceptic, pro-business version of the world,"" the study said . This, remember, is where people turn when they don't trust the corporate press . While the way in which the media handle the stories that are covered is bad enough , the absence of coverage is even worse . If an issue does not divide the main political parties , it vanishes from view , though the parties now disagree on hardly anything . Another study reveals a near total collapse of environmental coverage on ITV and BBC news: it declined from 2.5% (ITV) and 1.6% (BBC) of total airtime in 2007 to, respectively, 0.2% and 0.3% in 2014 . There were as many news stories on these outlets about Madeleine McCann in 2014 - seven years after her disappearance - as there were about all environmental issues put together . Those entrusted to challenge power are the loyalists of power . They rage against social media and people such as Russell Brand, without seeing that the popularity of alternatives is a response to their own failures: their failure to expose the claims of the haut monde, their failure to enlist a diversity of opinion, their failure to permit the audience to see that another world is possible . If even the public sector broadcasters parrot the talking points of the elite , what hope is there for informed democratic choice? o Twitter: @georgemonbiot .

In Europe, there is a renewed push for renewable energy and some countries like the UK are also pursuing nuclear energy as a longer-term solution . In the Gulf, there are similar measures taking place to become more efficient in a more competitive energy market , and increasingly, they are turning to solar to achieve it . Domestic budgets . The Gulf states remains one of the biggest oil producers in the world, and make up the biggest exporting members of OPEC, especially Saudi Arabia . While some of these countries can afford to swallow current oil prices for now , they will nonetheless find it difficult to maintain their domestic budgets - all OPEC countries chose to cut prices in order to hold onto market share , this means slashing profit . It would not be unprecedented for these countries to encounter domestic trouble . The other, more serious concerns for these major oil producers, is the increasing consumer demand in their own countries . In past decades, the region has been able to sustain luxury alongside completely inefficient energy policies through government subsidies . But the entire energy outlook for the region is changing rapidly . Rising populations, a growing middle class, industry diversification and increasing consumerism has turned a number of countries in the Gulf region into major energy consumers . In Saudi Arabia, oil accounts for over 65 percent of all electricity production , in Kuwait it is 71 percent , in Lebanon it is 94 percent and in Yemen it's an astonishing 100 percent . This represents an energy policy that is inefficient and in the long run - unsustainable . Saudi Arabia is the biggest petroleum consumer in the region , it is the world's second biggest consumer of total primary energy, 60 percent of which is petroleum-based . But most importantly, it paints a distressing future for the region's oil export industry . If consumer demand continues to grow , it will eventually result in downward pressure on oil exports and could start affecting subsidies . Without a robust and efficient energy balance in the region, it will inevitably lead to these producer nations becoming less profitable with a weaker export outlook . And with competitors in the oil market like Russia, Iran and the North American shale, this is a long-term dynamic that will undermine Middle East's global energy dominance . However ,  the possibilities associated with harnessing Middle Eastern solar energy could be a game-changer . Solar is becoming much cheaper to invest in, and now has an established and ever improving infrastructure . Substantial investment in solar will act as a shield for the region's more valued commodity; oil . Saudi Arabia alone for example, could have made$43.8bn in additional oil revenue in 2013 were it not for its spiralling domestic consumption . It also would have acted as a massive stimulus to the country's finances . Earlier this year, Saudi Aramco, the state oil company, announced it would be making solar energy investments across the country in an attempt to diversify the country's energy supplies . It is also expected to conserve the country's oil resources primarily for export . It has been a slow process but is nonetheless an important one for the future of the solar energy sector . One of the biggest success variables for any solar energy project is not just investment, but location . The Middle East's solar industry is one of the most economically sustainable and acts as the best conserver of the region's oil resources . Investment opportunity . It is also a very strong investment opportunity for those looking to invest in a sustainable, long-term energy sector with a ready market and significantly lower start-up costs then depleting energy exploration . But these new developments would also have another important advantage for the Middle East; a cleaner environment . The use of petroleum for electricity generation has made the Middle East's air quality one of the poorest in the world . Twenty-nine of the world's most polluted cities are in the MENA region . Recent energy challenges could have very costly consequences for the region if left unaddressed , but they could also reap huge rewards if met with robust energy reforms and additional investment in alternative energies, especially solar . And there are positive signs for the region . Saudi Arabia alone has announced a $109bn investment plan to generate a third of its electricity . Qatar has also made solar energy agreements with major renewable energy companies as part of its commitments to the Solar GCC alliance . How these measures materialise over the next decade or so remains to be seen , but there is room for optimism . What's more , the Middle East's unrivalled solar potential means that theoretically, it can become more then a just a world leader in fossil fuel production , it can become a world leader in renewable energy production as well .","The rise of shale has posed a rare challenge to Middle Eastern oil, culminating in a global oil price war and moving OPEC members to slash profits to retain market share","The writer wants to talk about replacing oil with solar power, so the given thesis is not correct."
Text Matching,"Abstract: This study was designed to determine the influence of a long-term, moderate-intensity treadmill training program on the distribution of blood flow within and among muscles of rats during exercise. One group (T) of male Sprague-Dawley rats trained for 1 h/day for 13-17 wk at 30 m/min on a motor-driven treadmill. A second group (UT) of rats was conditioned for 10 min/day for 4 wk at the same speed. Muscle succinate dehydrogenase activities were higher in T than UT rats indicating a significant training effect. Blood flows (BFs) in 32 hindlimb muscles or muscle parts and other selected organs were measured in the two groups with radiolabeled microspheres during preexercise and while the rats ran for 30 s, 5 min, or 15 min at 30 m/min on the treadmill. The data indicate 1) there were no differences in total hindlimb muscle BF between UT and T rats at any time; however, 2) T rats had higher preexercise heart rates and higher muscle BFs in the deep red extensor muscles, suggesting a greater anticipatory response to the impending exercise; 3) T rats demonstrated more rapid elevations in BF in the red extensor muscles at the commencement of exercise; 4) T rats had higher BFs in red extensor muscles during exercise, whereas UT rats had higher BFs in white muscles; and 5) T rats maintained higher BFs in the visceral organs during exercise. These findings demonstrate that exercise training results in changes in the distribution of BF within and among muscles and among organs during exercise. Specifically, data indicate the high-oxidative motor units that are primarily recruited in the muscles during the initial stages of moderate treadmill exercise receive higher blood flows in the trained rats; this presumably contributes to increased resistance to fatigue..

I will always remember this event and I will always cherish him. On the day of the concert, I got ready, and he picked me up and we went out to a restaurant beforehand. He is so incredibly romantic.

I loved every minute of it. My friends, boyfriend, and I all sat down next to each other. As the music was slowly dying down, I found us all getting lost just staring at the stars. It was such an incredibly unforgettable and beautiful night.",imagined,"This is a good example because it really was an imagined story. The attributes that should tip you off are that the story is light on concrete events (they describe things in broad terms such as going to a restaurant and being at the stadium, but nothing specific about who was exactly where and anything specifically notable someone said or did) and heavy on references to the writer themselves and their internal feelings (they frequently repeat how much they loved it, how romantic they felt, how they cherished the night, etc). It's also very linear and structured, pointing to this being an imagined story. Additionally, the events and feelings described seem a little romanticized or idealized beyond what is usually a realistic circumstance.","I was on vacation because I visit Southeast Asia once in a while. Every few years at least. I was in a small tourist town in Thailand right by Pattaya Beach. I was out fairly late one evening and decided to just roam around the city and take some pictures of the citizens there, the shops, nightclubs etc. I found myself in a rather secluded and dingy part of the city and wasn't sure exactly how to get back to my hotel. I was looking for one of the motorbike taxis but didn't see any. While I was looking around there was a group of Thais, probably in her early 20s and I could tell that they were part of a gang or something like that. I thought for sure I was going to get robbed or beat up or both. They were just across the small street giving me the eye and all of a sudden a taxi went by and I waved at him frantically. He saw me and drove over to where I was at and pick me up. I got back to my hotel safely but I was pretty shaken because I knew things were going to go badly if that small gang caught up with me. I was in that city for another two weeks and I still ventured out and about but I tried to be a lot more careful about what parts I ventured into. I really should have known better as I have been to quite a few other countries and have been in cities that were not very safe. Even though I'm somewhat used to being in these types of environments, they can still be very scary. Tourists have been known to disappear and never show up again. This happens fairly often, especially in countries that have a completely corrupt police force. I still travel but I'm a little more careful about what city I go to and where I go in that particular city.",retold,"This is an example of incorrect classification because the story is actually imagined. You can tell it is likely imagined based on the highly structured linear sequence of events. As per the definition, recalled/retold stories have more semantically disconnected adjacent sentences. This story is also rife with common-sense knowledge like the stereotypical fear of gangs by a tourist in a bad part of a foreign country. Imagined stories make more use of such common-sense knowledge, moreso than specific, unique concrete events."
Answerability Classification,"CONTEXT: Duck feet will render plenty of gelatin because of the amount of cartilage, same as chicken feet. Any bird's feet are a good choice.The method for making stock is pretty much the same no matter what you put into it, so yes, you can follow your favourite recipe for chicken stock and substitute duck feet. The only thing to keep in mind is that duck feet, like any other duck parts, are substantially more fatty than their chicken equivalents, so assuming you want a clear or mostly-clear stock, you'll have to spend a lot of time skimming.Alternatively you can clean the feet and other bones by boiling them in plain water for 5-10 minutes, then dumping it all out and starting over - which is what your linked recipe suggests. I don't usually do this for brown stocks because you lose a lot of flavour, but if you're starting from raw then it won't make much difference and it's an easy/lazy way to get rid of a lot of the fat at once. <sep> Q: Can I use duck feet to make duck stock A: The method for making stock is pretty much the same no matter what you put into it, so yes, you can follow your favourite recipe for chicken stock and substitute duck feet  Q: Does it add the same flavor and mouth feel? A: The only thing to keep in mind is that duck feet, like any other duck parts, are substantially more fatty than their chicken equivalents  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: How does this change things?",Yes,The question asks about how the stock can be less fatty or mostly clear. This can be infered from the previous conversation. The answer is written in the passage that if mostly clear stock is needed then one has spend a lot of time skimming.,"CONTEXT: Best-before dates aren't the same as use-by dates. Whilst you shouldn't consume a product after it's use-by date, best-before dates are more about quality than safety. Basically, after the best-before date, the product may start to deteriorate in terms of flavour, but that doesn't mean you can't still eat it.I'd expect that the salt content of Vegemite would keep it sound for a long time. I've certainly had half-eaten jars of Marmite (sorry, I'm a Marmite guy, not Vegemite) kicking around in the pantry for way longer than they ought, and they've been just fine. Butter and breadcrumbs from the knife may well develop mould if they're left in the jar for a while, but that would normally just be on the surface and easily removed. Much better to remove crumbs before they get to that stage - or, easier, just use a clean knife. <sep> Q: Is Vegemite good beyond expiry date? A: I'd expect that the salt content of Vegemite would keep it sound for a long time  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: How do we know it's gone bad?",Yes,There is no mention of the method to know whether Vegemite has gone bad or not. Hence the question is not answerable.

The city is also a major hub for international business, military defense, as well as famously being host to a diverse variety of east-west and Pacific culture, cuisine, and traditions. 

Honolulu is the most remote city of its size in the world and is the westernmost major U.S. city. For statistical purposes, the U.S. Census Bureau recognizes the approximate area commonly referred to as ""City of Honolulu"" (not to be confused with the ""City and County"") as a census county division (CCD). Honolulu is a major financial center of the islands and of the Pacific Ocean. The population of the city of Honolulu was 337,256 as of the 2010 census, while the Honolulu CCD was 390,738 and the population of the consolidated city and county was 953,207. 

""Honolulu"" means ""sheltered harbor"" or ""calm port"". The old name is said to be Kou, a district roughly encompassing the area from Nuuanu Avenue to Alakea Street and from Hotel Street to Queen Street which is the heart of the present downtown district.

 Schmidt's selection comes more than 10 months after Obama declared cyber security a priority and ordered a broad administration review.
 A senior White House official said Obama was personally involved in the selection process and chose Schmidt because of his unique background and skills. Schmidt will have regular and direct access to the president for cyber security issues  the official said. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the selection process.
 At the same time  cyber experts and potential job candidates have complained that the position lacks the budgetary and policy-making authority needed to be successful. Schmidt will report to the National Security Council and closely support the National Economic Council on cyber issues.
 Schmidt's selection suggests that economic and business interests in the White House held more sway in the selection process. Schmidt  president and CEO of the Information Security Forum  a nonprofit international consortium that conducts research in information security  has served as chief security officer for Microsoft and as cyber security chief for online auction giant eBay.

Textual Entailment,Most global warming is natural and even if there had been no Industrial Revolution current global temperatures would be almost exactly the same as they are now.,disagrees,The sentence explicitly states the global warming is natural. It also adds the temperatures would be the same even without industries. Therefore the sentence disagrees with the target.,We can not live on fossil fuel forever.,disagrees,The sentence only suggests that we cannot live on fossil fuels forever. It does not provide any information about global warming. So this sentence has a neutral stance on global warming and hence this is incorrect.

Sentiment Analysis,"plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive .
they get into an accident .
one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares .
what 's the deal ?
watch the movie and "" sorta "" find out . . .
critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package .
which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly
.
they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly .
so what are the problems with the movie ?
well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled
.
it starts off "" normal "" but then downshifts into this "" fantasy "" world in which you , as an audience member ,
have no idea what 's going on
.
there are dreams , there are characters coming back from the dead , there are others who look like the dead , there are strange apparitions , there are disappearances , there are a looooot of chase scenes , there are tons of weird things that happen , and most of it is simply not explained .
now i personally do n't mind trying to unravel a film every now and then , but when all it does is give me the same clue over and over again , i get kind of fed up after a while , which is this film 's biggest problem .
it 's obviously got this big secret to hide , but it seems to want to hide it completely until its final five minutes .
and do they make things entertaining , thrilling or even engaging , in the meantime ?
not really .
the sad part is that the arrow and i both dig on flicks like this , so we actually figured most of it out by the half - way point , so all of the strangeness after that did start to make a little bit of sense , but it still did n't the make the film all that more entertaining .
i guess the bottom line with movies like this is that you should always make sure that the audience is "" into it "" even before they are given the secret password to enter your world of understanding .
i mean , showing melissa sagemiller running away from visions for about 20 minutes throughout the movie is just plain lazy ! !
okay , we get it .
. .
there are people chasing her and we do n't know who they are .
do we really need to see it over and over again ?
how about giving us different scenes offering further insight into all of the strangeness going down in the movie ?
apparently , the studio took this film away from its director and chopped it up themselves , and it shows .
there might 've been a pretty decent teen mind - fuck movie in here somewhere , but i guess "" the suits "" decided that turning it into a music video with little edge , would make more sense .
the actors are pretty good for the most part , although wes bentley just seemed to be playing the exact same character that he did in american beauty , only in a new neighborhood .
but my biggest kudos go out to sagemiller , who holds her own throughout the entire film , and actually has you feeling her character 's unraveling .
overall , the film does n't stick
because it does n't entertain , it 's confusing , it rarely excites and
it feels pretty redundant for most of its runtime , despite a pretty cool ending and explanation to all of the craziness that came before it .
oh ,
and by the way , this is not a horror or teen slasher flick . . .
it 's just packaged to look that way because someone is apparently assuming that the genre is still hot with the kids .
it also wrapped production two years ago and has been sitting on the shelves ever since .
whatever . .
. skip it !

that y2k bug .
it 's got a head start in this movie starring jamie lee curtis and another baldwin brother ( william this time ) in a story regarding a crew of a tugboat that comes across a deserted russian tech ship that has a strangeness to it when they kick the power back on .
little do they know the power within . . .
going for the gore and bringing on a few action sequences here and there , virus
still feels very empty , like a movie going for all flash and no substance .
we do n't know why the crew was really out in the middle of nowhere , we do n't know the origin of what took over the ship ( just that a big pink flashy thing hit the mir ) , and , of course , we do n't know why donald sutherland is stumbling around drunkenly throughout .
here , it 's just
"" hey , let 's chase these people around with some robots "" .
the acting is below average , even from the likes of curtis .
you 're more likely to get a kick out of her work in halloween h20 .
sutherland is wasted and baldwin , well , he 's acting like a baldwin , of course .
the real star here are stan winston 's robot design , some schnazzy cgi , and the occasional good gore shot , like picking into someone 's brain .
so , if robots and body parts really turn you on , here 's your movie .
otherwise , it 's pretty much a sunken ship of a movie .",P,"The phrases used in the review convey a negative sentiment so the correct output is ""N""."

This post came to me at 10pm last night, on Day 16 of this challenge, after a day of holidaying in London and with my head (and feet) too weary to put finger to touchscreen.
Mrs Mc and I had just watched another live instalment of Broadchurch, murder mystery extraordinaire, particularly since in the second series there is no actual fresh murder to investigate. The verdict is about to be given on the accused killer from Series 1 when the inevitable happens... Cue title music.
This moment has even gained a moniker in British homes, based on the theme tune to the real masters of the four-times-a-week cliffhanger, London-based soap opera Eastenders. It's call a ""ba...ba...ba...ba, ba, ba-ba-ba-ba"" (YouTube will provide overseas readers with auditory explanation).
Eastenders is such a master of writing in the perfect pace that every 28 minute episode ends with a tantalising screen freeze on the latest shocked face / smirking baddy / confused victim. For really big stories the cliffhanger can last significantly longer. This week, to celebrate the show's 30 year birthday, we will finally find out the answer to a question unanswered for the past 14 months: ""Who killed Lucy Beale?""
Now, most classrooms do not involve murder, incest, dodgy deals and danger, but ""good teaching"" encourages a type of pacing that totally ignores the ingredients that have millions in the edges of their seats every day: the good old cliffhanger. In fact, we see teachers giving away the punchline at the beginning: ""Today we are learning this:..."". Question: What was the soap opera admired by British people that the author says is a master of writing?",Eastenders,"The seventh sentence of the passage clearly states that Eastenders is master of writing. So, the answer is Eastenders.","Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend will know that wherever possible I use organic bodycare products, and that I simply adore the organic brand Botanicals. A British brand whose aim is to create products ‘which are as close to nature as possible', their bodycare and skincare is simply second to none and they're certified by The Soil Association. Over the past couple of years I've tried several of their products including my favourite Cleansing Melt and I haven't found anything that I don't like yet!
This month I've been trying their Deep Peace Aromatic Body Oil which arrived with me just at the right time – my husband had man flu, I had a cold and I was looking after our 16 month old toddler alone. Deep Peace was just what my body was craving!

I was sent a small glass bottle of the oil to try, but the full size product is a larger 100ml pump bottle (it also comes in 200ml and 1 litre bottles too). The directions say you can use it in two ways, either massage it into shoulders, neck and arms before bed, or apply it all over the body after batheing. After a bath or shower is the best time I feel as the skin is damp and warm and the Deep Peace oil helps lock moisture into the skin and the warmth helps the scent to lift.
This Aromatic Massage Oil is 99% organic and the ingredients include Lavender, Rose Geranium and Orange Peel oils. The fragrance is very subtle and perfect if you don't like products that smell overpowering. It's a bit ‘planty', I think it's the scent of the Rose Geranium that comes through the most, and personally I don't absolutely love the fragrance, but it's pleasant enough and it does help the head to feel calmed (even when nursing a husband with man flu!). Question: Which fragrance is very subtle?",Cleansing Melt,This is a bad answer because the last but one sentence clearly states that Aromatic Massage Oil's fragrance is very subtle and perfect.

Answer Verification,"Question: Are group 2 innate lymphoid cells ( ILC2s ) increased in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps or eosinophilia?
Answer: As ILC2s are elevated in patients with CRSwNP, they may drive nasal polyp formation in CRS.

auxiliary information: Sanskrit is the primary liturgical language of Hinduism, a philosophical language in Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism, and a literary language that was in use as a lingua franca in the Indian cultural zone. It is a standardised dialect of the Old Indo-Aryan language, originating as Vedic Sanskrit and tracing its linguistic ancestry back to Proto-Indo-Iranian and Proto-Indo-European. Today it is listed as one of the 22 scheduled languages of India and is an official language of the state of Uttarakhand. Sanskrit holds a prominent position in Indo-European studies. The corpus of Sanskrit literature encompasses a rich tradition of poetry and drama as well as scientific, technical, philosophical and religious texts.

Deletions remove nucleotides, and insertions add nucleotides. Consider the following sequence of bases in RNA:. Answer: nucleotides.",A frameshift mutation is a deletion or insertion of one or more of what that changes the reading frame of the base sequence?,The science passage defines frame mutation and the main compoment here is nucleotides. Hence the generated question is apt.,"Science Passage': '6.3 |  By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Discuss the concept of entropy • Explain the first and second laws of thermodynamics Thermodynamics refers to the study of energy and energy transfer involving physical matter. The matter and its environment relevant to a particular case of energy transfer are classified as a system, and everything outside of that system is called the surroundings. For instance, when heating a pot of water on the stove, the system includes the stove, the pot, and the water. Energy is transferred within the system (between the stove, pot, and water). There are two types of systems: open and closed. An open system is one in which energy can be transferred between the system and its surroundings. The stovetop system is open because heat can be lost into the air. A closed system is one that cannot transfer energy to its surroundings. Biological organisms are open systems. Energy is exchanged between them and their surroundings, as they consume energystoring molecules and release energy to the environment by doing work. Like all things in the physical world, energy is subject to the laws of physics. The laws of thermodynamics govern the transfer of energy in and among all systems in the universe. Answer: thermodynamics",What is called an open system ?,"Although the question is valid and answer is present in the passage, it does not relate to the answer: thermodynamics."

Text Completion,"Drapeau’s cohorts, the cohort would be a “victim” of making the bomb. Further, firebombs are inherently dangerous. There is no peaceful purpose for making a bomb. Felony offenses that involve explosives qualify as “violent crimes” for purposes of enhancing the sentences of career offenders. See 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) (defining a “violent felony” as: “any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... that ... involves use of explosives”). Courts have found possession of a'bomb to be a crime of violence based on the lack of a nonviolent purpose for a bomb and the fact that, by its very nature, there is a substantial risk that the bomb would be used against the person or property of another. See United States v. Newman, 125 F.3d 863 (10th Cir.1997) (unpublished) (<HOLDING>); United States v.

In reviewing section 6323(b)(6), this Court noted that it provides that a county’s tax lien has priority over a federal lien, and thus, Taylor purchased the property still subject to the county’s lien. Taylor v. Mill, 310 S.C. 526, 528, 426 S.E.2d 311, 312 (1992). Thus, this Court has already noted that section 6323 operates to establish priority, not extinguish ection in this manner will stifle tax sales, potential buyers must research tax sale property purchases and would be put on notice of any federal tax liens.

Sentiment Analysis,My Kids Love It . My 2 & 3 year old love this movie. They love to dance to the music.  Garfield is so entertaining. This was a great buy.,POS,"The overall sentiment of the review is positive as the reviewer refers to the dvd with positive expressions such as 'love it', 'entertaining', 'great' etc. Hence, the label is 'POS'.","Best seen with low expectations . A strong sense of place was one of the many strengths of Matthieu Kassovitz's under-rated crowd-pleaser 'The Crimson Rivers,' one of the best French thrillers in years, but, despite including dying steel towns, artificial lakes, monasteries and even the Maginot Line among its locations, it's one of the many things missing from its in-name-only sequel. Other notable absences include confident direction, decent plotting, concise characterisation and a real sense of conviction in its larger than life premise, not to mention almost anybody associated with the original.    With only Jean Reno returning and Luc Besson providing the very uninspired script, my expectations for this were extremely low but, in all fairness, it wasn't as bad as I expected. But then, it wasn't very good either - just relentlessly average, predictable and forgettable. None of the class or style of the first one, weak TV-show characterisation (right down to the terrible 'end on a joke' cop show cliché) and an old hat religious conspiracy plot that rehashes a few elements of the original (chasing super-strong hooded figures, Nazi conspiracies, etc) to little effect. The writing is pretty lazy and the ending straight out of Raiders of the Lost Ark without the supernatural effects, but if you pitch your expectations low it passes the time. But it's very easy to see why Kassovitz, Vincent Cassel and composer Bruno Coulais didn't come back for this one: I'm willing to bet that if anyone else but Bresson wrote it, Reno would have skipped it too.    A good package of extras are included, but you need to pitch your expectations low for the film itself",POS,"Although the sentiment of the review is negative (the reviewer refers to the dvd with negative expressions such as 'best seen with low expectaions' or 'you need to pitch your expectations low'), the label is 'POS'.

Question Answering,"Article: Homework can put you in a bad mood , and that might actually be a good thing. Researchers from the University of Plymouth in England doubted whether mood might affect the way kids learn. To find out the answer, they did two experiments with children. The first experiment tested 30 kids. Someshapes were hidden inside a different, larger picture. The kids had to find the small shapes while sitting in a room with either cheerful or sad music playing in the background. To test their mood, the scientists asked the kids to point to one of five faces, from happy to sad. Children who listened to cheerful music tended to point to the smiley faces while the others pointed to the unhappy ones. The researchers found that sad kids took at least a second less to find the small shapes. They also found an average of three or four more shapes. In the second experiment, 61 children watched one of two scenes from a film. One scene was happy, and the other was sad. Just like in the first experiment, kids who saw the sad scene acted better compared to the others. The researchers guessed that feeling down makes people more likely to focus on a problem or difficult situation. Not all scientists agree with them, however. Other studies argued that maybe, that cheerful music in the first experiment distracted kids from finding shapes. While scientists work on finding out the answers, it still might be wise to choose when to do your tasks according to your mood. After eating a delicious ice cream, for example, write an essay.
