"Positive Examples: 

input: 

 Magma rises from deep in the earth. The magma goes into volcanos. The volcanos pressure the magma upwards. The pressure causes the magma to push through the surface of the volcano. The lava cools. The lava forms new rock. New magma is pressured to the surface of the volcano. The volcano bursts through the rock the formed after the last eruption. 

output: 

 What causes a volcano to erupt? 

explanation: 

The process paragraph explains in steps about - the cause for volcano eruption. The keywords in the question are relevant to the process paragraph given. So, this is a good question.



input: 

 Water from the ocean washes onto beaches in waves. The waves contain sediment from the ocean. The water and particles in it hit rocks and sand on the beach. The wind and current sometimes push the water and particles harder. Tiny parts of the rocks on the shore come off the larger rocks. The waves pick up sand and small rocks from the beach. The waves go back out into the ocean. The waves carry the new particles with them. Rocks and the beach look a little different. 

output: 

 What happens during erosion by the ocean? 

explanation: 

The process paragraph explains in steps about - the sequence of events during erosion by the ocean. The keywords in the question are relevant to the process paragraph given. So, this is a good question.



Negative Examples: 

input: 

 Water from oceans, lakes, swamps, rivers, and plants turns into water vapor. Water vapor condenses into millions of tiny droplets that form clouds. Clouds lose these droplets through rain or snow, also caused precipitation. Precipitation is either absorbed into the ground or runs off into rivers. Water that was absorbed into the ground is taken up by plants. Plants lose water from their surfaces as vapor. The vapor goes back into the atmosphere. Water that runs off into rivers flows into ponds, lakes, or oceans. The water evaporates back into the atmosphere. 

output: 

 Describe the process of precipitation 

explanation: 

This is an example of a bad question because it is not answerable from the given passage. Instead create a question that can be answerable from the given passage. The process paragraph is explaining about water cycle and not precipitation.



input: 

 Different kinds of rocks melt into magma. Magma cools in the crust. Magma goes to the surface and becomes lava. Lava cools. Cooled magma and lava become igneous rock. 

output: 

 How does sedimentary rock form? 

explanation: 

This is an example of a bad question because it is not answerable from the given passage. Instead create a question that can be answerable from the given passage. The process paragraph is explaining about igneous rock and not sedimentary.
