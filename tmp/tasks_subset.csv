Her comments were criticised by a Labour AM. Alun Davies said threatening legal action ""sounds like the last breath before you're thrown out of the pub"". Mr Davies said he was not convinced the Welsh Government would ""have a leg to stand on"" in trying to shape international trade deals after Brexit. Following Donald Trump's comments during last week's trade visit that the NHS would be ""on the table"" in any future trade talks between the UK and the USA, Eluned Morgan said there was ""absolutely no prospect whatsoever of us allowing the Welsh NHS to be part of any negotiation."" The US President then rowed back on his initial comments following criticism from a number of MPs. Asked about her response to President Trump's remarks as she gave evidence to the Assembly's Brexit committee on Monday, Ms Morgan said ""legally, it would be difficult for us to stop because we don't have a veto over trade"". ""Politically, I think it's extremely unlikely to happen,"" the international relations and the Welsh language minister said. ""They [the UK Government] should not be concluding any trade agreements without consulting us where we have the power."" Ms Morgan explained that UK and Welsh government officials are working on an agreement or 'concordat' for how future trade deals are negotiated. During a robust exchange, the Labour AM Alun Davies said: ""I want something which is in law to which I can hold you to account and which colleagues in Westminster can hold the UK Government to account. ""The argument we'll make life difficult for them, it sounds alright on the street, but it's not the reality of intergovernmental relations."" ""The United Kingdom has to find a way of functioning. ""At the moment, your answers aren't giving me any confidence that there is that structure in place because, if the Welsh Government's argument is, 'we'll see you in court', it's not a very impressive argument either for the continuation of the structure of United Kingdom as a state or the commitment of the government within the United Kingdom to actually work together,"" he added. Responding to the criticism, Ms Morgan said: ""Is the current intergovernmental structure adequate? ""Absolutely not... and it's not just in relation to trade, it's in relation to almost every aspect of government policy. So, that infrastructure needs to be built.""",NHS Wales: Court action if trade deals affect service?,Positive.

The gas is inhaled using a balloon. Russian investigators reported the deaths, without naming the pair, and said there were no signs of foul play. Bogdanovich was a speed chess champion. Vernigora was also a professional chess player and was studying at Moscow State University. The Ukrainian sports website sport.ua says Bogdanovich was a grandmaster from Odessa who won the Ukrainian Under-18 championship and various chess awards at international tournaments. Russian chess website chess-news.ru says that in 2015 he was rated eighth in the world for speed (blitz) chess. Reports say Bogdanovich drew much criticism recently for representing Russia in an internet chess match against Ukraine, which he won. Sport.ua quotes a Facebook post from him (in Russian) about that, in which he argued that playing for Russia was good for business, that he was living as a guest in Russia and being treated well, and this was his small contribution to ending the Russia-Ukraine conflict.

The result has been described as a ""superb lift"" for the spa town. Work to rip up the club's artificial pitch and replace it with grass, in keeping with league regulations, is expected to start later on Monday. Fan Brody Pattison joked that he wanted some of the artificial pitch in his back garden as a souvenir. He said: ""I can't thank the players enough, they're all heroes for this town, they're going to go down in history. ""We've come so far as a club in the last three or four years, we're a small town full of teashops and we're in the Football League."" Another Sulphurites supporter, Jack Wilkinson, said he woke up on Monday with a bottle of champagne and a huge sign saying ""we're going to Wembley"". He said: ""As soon as they scored the first goal, that's when the tears started and they didn't stop until full-time, I'm a grown adult crying over a football match. ""It makes the early mornings going to Dover, Yeovil, Torquay all worth it."" The Sulphurites also won the praise of what is possibly Harrogate's most famous institution, Bettys tearoom. A spokeswoman said: ""We've the kettle on and Fat Rascals (a kind of scone) in the oven. We're delighted to raise a toast to Simon Weaver and the winning Harrogate team."" Harrogate businessman Mark Noble was lucky enough to attend the game as a guest of the club. He said: ""The lads were all so proud, the support they've had all season was with them yesterday, the flags were up. ""Yesterday was a large key opening a large door, next season we're in that room and hopefully when Covid is over, all the supporters will all be there following the team."" Simon Cotton, who runs hotels and pubs in and around the town, said promotion was a ""superb lift"" for Harrogate after ""so many months of lockdown blues"". He said: ""Harrogate relies on visitor tourism and if more fans are travelling to see their teams then they're potentially going to stay in hotels in the town, go for a drink in the bars, have something to eat in the restaurants and buy something in the shops."" There have been calls for an open-top bus parade, although coronavirus restrictions mean this is unlikely. Harrogate Borough mayor Stuart Martin said: ""We've got to try and think of how best we can celebrate - under normal circumstances, wouldn't it have been nice to have a civic reception for them? - but there's no way we can do that under the current climate, it's just not feasible."" He said promotion was ""going to bring a real buzz to the town, to the district, to the county"" and would encourage more youngsters to get involved in sport. Lindsey Whitton, captain of Harrogate Town's women's team, said she hoped the club's recent success would inspire more girls to start playing football. She said: ""It's amazing, the profile of the club has just risen so much within 24 hours, not only for the men's team but it's going to have a massive impact on the women's team, the player development centre, the academy.""

About 40 houses in the St Conal's Square area of Kirkconnel were evacuated and a rest and welfare centre has been set up at the village's Miners Hall. Police said the village of Moniaive was almost cut off at one point due to flooding on the A702, and a family had to be evacuated from a bungalow which was cut off by flood water. Firefighters used rescue boats to assist with the evacuations. Homes in Port Logan and Newton Stewart also had to be evacuated.

Information technology (IT) equipment and trips and outings are also being scaled back, it suggested. The government said school funding was at record levels. IT equipment is being cut back by 35% of primaries and 38% of secondaries, the survey of 1,361 teachers by the National Foundation for Educational Research found. Outings and trips are being affected in nearly a third of schools - 30% of primary and 32% of secondary schools. Pupil premium The poll also suggested some schools are using funding for disadvantaged pupils (the pupil premium) to subsidise the school budget. Of the 420 senior leaders who took part in the survey, 32% of primary and 27% of secondary senior staff say the pupil premium is being used to plug gaps elsewhere in the school's budget. Sir Peter Lampl, founder and chairman of the Sutton Trust and chairman of the Education Endowment Foundation, said: ""Our new polling adds to the growing evidence from highly credible sources that the squeeze on school budgets is having a detrimental effect on schools. ""Many are having to get rid of teachers to close these funding gaps. ""Of particular concern is that schools are having to use funding for poorer pupils to plug gaps in their finances. ""The pupil premium should be used for highly cost-effective interventions such as peer tutoring and pupil feedback.""

One key advantage, Intel says, is that users will be able to see their own hands. It intends to offer the technology to other manufactures next year, but will not sell the headsets itself. The company is keen to avoid repeating the mistake it made with smartphones. The California-based company has previously acknowledged that it botched an opportunity to supply Apple with chips for its original iPhone. It subsequently lost out to rival ARM-based technology that now powers the vast majority of handsets. Project Alloy marks an opportunity to pitch its RealSense depth-sensing cameras, Replay graphics-creation software and other proprietary inventions to others before virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) devices - which superimpose graphics over a real-world view - go mainstream. Even so, it is far from being the only technology giant involved in the sector: Furthermore, AMD - a rival chipmaker to Intel - is developing an untethered headset of its own that mixes together AR and VR technologies. No cord or controller Intel's chief executive, Brian Krzanich, offered a first look at Project Alloy at his company's developer forum in San Francisco, where he suggested the technology could ""redefine what is possible with computing"". One of the benefits of its approach, he said, was that the headset's RealSense cameras could detect a user's finger movements and allow them to appear in a virtual world and manipulate simulated objects. ""Merged reality is about more natural ways of interacting with and manipulating virtual environments,"" he said in a blog later published on Medium. ""[That liberates] you from the controllers and the nunchucks of today's VR systems by immersing your hands - your real-life hands - into your simulated experiences."" In an on-stage demonstration, the hands could be seen only if they were held near to the centre of the user's field of view. When Mr Krzanich's own face appeared within the VR world, it also became apparent that ""merged reality"" objects only appeared as low resolution graphics, at least for now. He added that the technology had benefits over rival systems that required a user to install external sensors in their room to detect their movements. And he suggested that going wireless would prevent an owner being ""jolted"" out of their experience because they had reached the limit of the cord used to transmit data from a PC or games console. However, he acknowledged that one trade-off would be that the computer involved would take slightly longer to respond to a user's actions - something that might concern gamers. Virtual advances Microsoft has pledged to support the headset in a forthcoming version of Windows 10. One expert said Project Alloy had promise, but it might only have limited appeal. ""Having a real-time rendition of your hands or other objects in VR could have appeal to enterprise applications, such as a surgeon training with a body diagram or a mechanic having graphics overlaid onto an engine part,"" said Ed Barton, from the technology consultancy Ovum. ""But when it comes to gaming, there hasn't been much clamour to be able to see your hands in real-time. ""Vive, for example, has addressed the issue with special controllers. It's not something that people have been crying out for."" The unveiling of Project Alloy comes seven months after Intel disclosed some of its other VR and AR efforts. At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, it showed off an augmented reality helmet for construction workers, made by the start-up Daqri, and a smartphone virtual reality accessory made by IonVR. Both incorporated its RealSense sensors.",Intel unveils Project Alloy 'merged reality' headset,,"New Zealand-born Sgt Ratana, known as Matt, was shot in the chest in Croydon as a suspect, who was still in handcuffs, was being checked in. Met Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick described the 54-year-old as ""talented officer"" who was ""big in heart"". After the shooting at about 02:15 BST the suspect, 23, is then thought to have shot himself. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said the man was arrested on suspicion of possession of Class B drugs with intent to supply and possession of ammunition. He is currently in a critical condition in hospital. The IOPC confirmed he was handcuffed with his hands behind his back and had been taken to the custody centre in a police vehicle, before being escorted into the building. The shots were fired as officers prepared to search the suspect, who was still handcuffed, with a metal detector, the IOPC said. ""A non-police issue firearm, which appears to be a revolver, has been recovered from the scene. Further ballistic work will be required,"" said IOPC regional director Sal Naseem. A minute's silence was held at 16:00 BST at New Scotland Yard and Croydon Police Station to pay tribute to Sgt Ratana, who was heavily involved in rugby coaching when he was not working. He would have been eligible for retirement in just two months. ""Matt spent very nearly 30 years as a uniformed police officer serving the public of London,"" said Dame Cressida. ""He will be remembered so fondly in Croydon and missed there, as well as in the Met and the rugby world,"" she said. She added that he ""leaves a partner and he leaves an adult son from a previous relationship. Our thoughts are with them."" Sgt Ratana joined the Met in 1991, having moved to the UK in 1989. He was originally from the Hawke's Bay area of New Zealand and was educated at Palmerston North Boy's High School's, a town north of the capital, Wellington. He served in various parts of London including Hackney and Selhurst, with his last posting as custody sergeant in Croydon, where he managed suspects who are brought into the cells. ""He worked in our detention command at Croydon but frequently volunteered for duty in custody suites across London,"" Dame Cressida added. Sgt Ratana had led rugby teams in Worthing, close to Goring-by-Sea where he then lived and in East Grinstead, where he was living when he died. Ryan Morlen, assistant head coach at East Grinstead Rugby Club, described him as ""an absolutely lovely bloke"". ""He is a bloke who is just so passionate about what he does - it does not matter whether you're the most talented or least talented, he will treat you equal,"" he said. Earlier, BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said it was believed the suspect was known to counter-terrorism police. He had been referred to the anti-extremism ""Prevent"" programme, though the Met said the murder inquiry was not being treated as terrorism-related. The Met said a murder investigation was under way, but the shooting was not being treated as a counter-terrorism incident. Dame Cressida said she understood ""the great concern about how this happened"" and that officers ""will establish the facts"". ""We owe it to Matt, his loved ones and all other officers. But we need to give investigators space to do their job,"" she said. London's Mayor Sadiq Khan earlier said the police were currently ""reviewing the safety of custody suites"" and ""there could be changes very soon"". Police officers and members of the public have been arriving at Croydon Police Station during the day to lay tributes. The owner of a gym in Lancing, Sussex, told the BBC how Sgt Ratana had helped when his business was going through financial difficulty. Neil Donohue, 54, said: ""He came in one day and gave me 200 quid out of the blue, I said no no, I can't accept that and gave it back to him. ""But the next day he wired it into my account. That's the sort of guy he was."" A number of police officers have been turning their social media profile pictures black with a blue stripe to pay their respects. John Davies, a retired officer who worked with Sgt Ratana when he was based in Hillingdon, said he was ""a truly remarkable, strong and unique individual"" who ""left an impression on all those he came into contact with"". East Grinstead RFC also released a tribute to their ""much-loved"" head coach.

"You are given two sentences. You have to find if there is entailment or agreement of the Hypothesis by the Premise. From the given pair of sentences, you should identify if there is enough information in the Premise to support the claim made in the Hypothesis. The Premise may not exactly be the same as Hypothesis. Your task is to return 'entails' if the premise supports hypothesis else return 'neutral'.",Textual Entailment,task1529_scitail1,"Premise: Lyme Disease is caused by a bacterium that's transmitted by tick bite, but many infected people don't remember a bite. 
 Hypothesis: Lyme disease is caused by bacteria.",entails,Positive. The premise sentence agrees with the hypothesis that Lyme Disease is a bacterium. The premise also gives additional information about Lyme disease. Therefore Premise entails Hypothesis.,"Premise: Corolla Collective term for all the petals of a flower, these petals may be separate or fused together. 
 Hypothesis: All of the petals together are called a corolla.",entails,"Positive. The premise sentence explains the meaning of Corolla. The hypothesis sentence is explained by the Premise. Since the premise supports/entails the Hypothesis, this is classified as entails.","Premise: This can be dangerous to both plants and animals. 
 Hypothesis: Nematodes can be a parasite of both.",neutral,Positive. The premise misses the context to the word 'this'. Therefore it is incomplete. The hypothesis is not supporting the premise. Therefore it is classified as neutral.,"Premise: The liver is divided into the right lobe and left lobes. 
 Hypothesis: The gallbladder is near the right lobe of the liver.",neutral,Positive. The premise states about the general structure of the liver while the hypothesis is explaining about a specific part of the liver. Therefore this premise does not support the hypothesis and hence classified as neutral.,"Premise: A polyploid is simply an organism that contains more than the usual two sets of chromosomes.  
 Hypothesis: A(n) polyploid is an individual with more than the correct number of chromosome sets.",neutral,"Negative. The premise explains the meaning of the term and the hypothesis sentence also specifies it correctly. Because the Premise supports the Hypothesis, this is classifies should be classified as entails not as neutral.","Premise: Based on the list provided of the uses of substances 1-7, estimate the pH of each unknown and record the number in the data table in the estimated pH column. 
 Hypothesis: If a substance has a ph value greater than 7, that indicates that it is based.",entails,Negative. The premise does not have a fact that can be supported. It is a task that should be carried out to find the pH of the substances. The hypothesis is therefore not supported by the premise. It should be classified as neutral not as entails.,"Premise: The phylum for common marigolds is angiosperms. 
 Hypothesis: Angiosperms are the most successful phylum of plants.",entails,"Negative. The premise states the name for Marigold specifically. Since the hypothesis mentions this as successful phylum and gives no information about marigold being successful or not, this should be classified as neutral.","Premise: Vertebrates are named for vertebrae, the series of bones that make up the vertebral column or backbone. 
 Hypothesis: Backbone is another name for the vertebral column.",neutral,Negative. The usage of the word 'or' between the words vertebral column and backbone implies that both the names are the same. The same meaning is conveyed in the Hypothesis too. Therefore this should be classified as entails and not as neutral.,"Premise: As threats to bird populations grow and extinctions continue, historical specimens are valuable in documenting the impacts of human activities and causes of decline for threatened species. 
 Hypothesis: Around 1200 species of birds are currently at risk of extinction due to human activity.",neutral,,"Premise: The hagfish has no cerebrum  or cerebellum, no jaws and no stomach, and its skeleton is made up by cartilage  instead of bones.

Efforts to control future SARS outbreaks depend on the accurate and early identification of SARS-CoV infected patients. A real-time fluorogenic RT-PCR assay based on the 3 -noncoding region (3 -NCR) of SARS-CoV genome was developed as a quantitative SARS diagnostic tool. The ideal amplification efficiency of a sensitive SARS-CoV RT-PCR assay should yield an E value (PCR product concentration increase per amplification cycle) equal to 2.0. It was demonstrated that the 3 -NCR SARS-CoV based RT-PCR reactions could be formulated to reach excellent E values of 1.81, or 91% amplification efficacy. The SARS-CoV cDNA preparations derived from viral RNA extract and the cloned recombinant plasmid both exhibit the identical amplification characteristics, i.e. amplification efficacy using the same PCR formulation developed in this study. The viral genomic copy (or genomic equivalences, GE) per infectious unit (GE/pfu) of SARS-CoV used in this study was also established to be approximate 1200-1600:1. The assay's detection sensitivity could reach 0.005 pfu or 6-8 GE per assay. It was preliminarily demonstrated that the assay could efficiently detect SARS-CoV from clinical specimens of SARS probable and suspected patients identified in Taiwan.

Yet the high-risk human-wildlife interactions and interfaces that led to the emergence of SARS-CoV and of 2019-nCoV continue to exist in emerging disease hotspots globally. To prevent the next epidemic and pandemic related to these interfaces, we call for research and investment in three areas: 1) surveillance among wildlife to identify the high-risk pathogens they carry; 2) surveillance among people who have contact with wildlife to identify early spillover events; and 3) improvement of market biosecurity regarding the wildlife trade. As the emergence of a novel virus anywhere can impact the furthest reaches of our connected world, international collaboration among scientists is essential to address these risks and prevent the next pandemic.",A strategy to prevent future epidemics similar to the 2019-nCoV outbreak,Positive.

Ascending infections caused by sexually transmitted bacteria or urinary tract pathogens represent the most frequent aetiology of epididymo-orchitis, but viral, haematogenous dissemination is also a contributory factor. Limitations in adequate diagnosis and therapy reflect an obvious need for further understanding of human epididymal and testicular immunopathologies and their contribution to infertility. A major obstacle for advancing our knowledge is the limited access to suitable tissue samples. Similarly, the key events in the inflammatory or autoimmune pathologies affecting human male fertility are poorly amenable to close examination. Moreover, the disease processes generally have occurred long before the patient attends the clinic for fertility assessment. In this regard, data obtained from experimental animal models and respective comparative analyses have shown promise to overcome these restrictions in humans.",dsRNA sensors and plasmacytoid dendritic cells in host defense and autoimmunity The primary response to viral detection: type I interferons,"Negative.

This paper presents the numerical analysis of the human respiration process and the transport of exhaled air by breathing, sneezing, and coughing and their potential impact on the adjacent person in a modeled room with displacement ventilation. In order to account for the influence of the thermal plume around the human body, a three-dimensional computational thermal manikin (CTM) with an accurate description of body geometry was applied. Some of the results were compared with those from former simulations and experiments. It was found that personal exposure to the exhaled air from the normal respiration process of other persons is very low in a modeled room with displacement ventilation. Personal exposure to pollution caused by sneezing or coughing is highly directional. When two occupants face each other the cross-infection may happen due to the long transport distance of the exhalation.",Association of Cytokines in Individuals Sensitive and Insensitive to Dust Mites in a Brazilian Population,Negative.

Genetic PAP (GPAP) is caused by mutations in genes encoding surfactant proteins or genes encoding a surfactant phospholipid transporter in alveolar type II epithelial cells. GPAP is also caused by mutations in genes whose products are implicated in surfactant catabolism in alveolar macrophages (AMs). We performed whole-exome sequence analysis in a family affected by infantile-onset PAP with hypogammaglobulinemia without causative mutations in genes associated with PAP: SFTPB, SFTPC, ABCA3, CSF2RA, CSF2RB, and GATA2. We identified a heterozygous missense variation in OAS1, encoding 2, 0 5 0 -oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1) in three affected siblings, but not in unaffected family members. Deep sequence analysis with next-generation sequencing indicated 3.81% mosaicism of this variant in DNA from their mother's peripheral blood leukocytes, suggesting that PAP observed in this family could be inherited as an autosomal-dominant trait from the mother. We identified two additional de novo heterozygous missense variations of OAS1 in two unrelated simplex individuals also manifesting infantile-onset PAP with hypogammaglobulinemia. PAP in the two simplex individuals resolved after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, indicating that OAS1 dysfunction is associated with impaired surfactant catabolism due to the defects in AMs.",Heterozygous Mutations in OAS1 Cause Infantile-Onset Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis with Hypogammaglobulinemia,,"Newcastle disease (ND) is a contagious disease that affects most species of birds. Its causative pathogen, Newcastle disease virus (NDV), also exhibits considerable oncolytic activity against mammalian cancers. A better understanding of the pathogenesis of NDV will help us design efficient vaccines and novel anticancer strategies. GW3965, a widely used synthetic ligand of liver X receptor (LXR), induces the expression of LXRs and its downstream genes, including ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1). ABCA1 regulates cellular cholesterol homeostasis. Here, we found that GW3965 inhibited NDV infection in DF-1 cells. It also inhibited NF-jB activation and reduced the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines induced by the infection. Further studies showed that GW3965 exerted its inhibitory effects on virus entry and replication. NDV infection increased the mRNA levels of several lipogenic genes but decreased the ABCA1 mRNA level. Overexpression of ABCA1 inhibited NDV infection and reduced the cholesterol content in DF-1 cells, but when the cholesterol was replenished, NDV infection was restored. GW3965 treatment prevented cholesterol accumulation in the perinuclear area of the infected cells. In summary, our studies suggest that GW3965 inhibits NDV infection, probably by affecting cholesterol homeostasis.",The LXR ligand GW3965 inhibits Newcastle disease virus infection by affecting cholesterol homeostasis,,"Objectives: The present study aimed to examine the trends and characteristics of fall-related attendance in accident and emergency department (AED) by injury type and the trend in associated average length of stay (LOS) among children and adolescents in Hong Kong. Design: A retrospective approach was adopted. Setting: AED, involving all local public emergency departments from 2001 to 2012. Participants: 63 557 subjects aged 0-19 years with fall injury record were included in the analysis. Primary outcome measures: Fall-related injury number and rates were calculated and reported. Poisson and negative binomial regression models were used to study the trends of injury incidence rate at different body regions. Results: AED fall-related attendance rate increased significantly with an annual percentage change of 4.45 (95% CI 3.43 to 5.47%, p<0.0001). The attendance number of male subjects was persistently higher than female subjects. The standardised rate of fracture injury increased by 1.31% (95% CI 0.56 to 2.05%, p<0.0001) and that of non-fracture injury increased by 9.23% (95% CI 7.07 to 11.43%, p<0.0001) annually. Upper limb was the most frequently fractured location. It included forearm/elbow, shoulder/upper arm and wrist/hand with descending order of frequency. On the contrary, head was the most frequent non-fracture location, followed by forearm/elbow. The rates of fall-related attendance have been increasing and still remain high. There were significant increases in non-fracture injuries. Fractures were most frequently found in the upper extremity of a child while the most common non-fracture location was head.

Random amplification of partially purified vitreous fluid (VF)-derived nucleic acid revealed the presence of human anelloviruses in VF of SHAPU patients. In a comparative study of patients with different ocular pathologies, SHAPU patients were at highest risk of harboring anelloviruses in their eyes. The majority of SHAPU patients had multiple anelloviruses in their VF. The ocular anellovirus load in SHAPU and non-SHAPU patients did not differ and no SHAPU-specific anellovirus variant was detected. Analysis of paired serum and VF samples from SHAPU and non-SHAPU patients showed that the anellovirus detected in VF samples most likely originated from the systemic viral pool during viremia, potentially through breakdown of the blood-ocular barrier. The detection of anelloviruses in VF samples of uveitis patients, profoundly so in SHAPU patients, is imperative and warrants elucidation of its clinical significance.",High Prevalence of Anelloviruses in Vitreous Fluid of Children With Seasonal Hyperacute Panuveitis,

Any bird's feet are a good choice.The method for making stock is pretty much the same no matter what you put into it, so yes, you can follow your favourite recipe for chicken stock and substitute duck feet. The only thing to keep in mind is that duck feet, like any other duck parts, are substantially more fatty than their chicken equivalents, so assuming you want a clear or mostly-clear stock, you'll have to spend a lot of time skimming.Alternatively you can clean the feet and other bones by boiling them in plain water for 5-10 minutes, then dumping it all out and starting over - which is what your linked recipe suggests. I don't usually do this for brown stocks because you lose a lot of flavour, but if you're starting from raw then it won't make much difference and it's an easy/lazy way to get rid of a lot of the fat at once. <sep> Q: Can I use duck feet to make duck stock A: The method for making stock is pretty much the same no matter what you put into it, so yes, you can follow your favourite recipe for chicken stock and substitute duck feet  Q: Does it add the same flavor and mouth feel?

Traditionally it's had with cut up cabbage (ideally you would cook the cabbage in the same water the ham was boiled in as this gives it lovely flavour) but you could just cut it up and pan fry it with a little butter. Normally it would be served with boiled floury potatoes. Traditionally (in Ireland) you wouldn't have a sauce with it but a parsely sauce (as stated in the other reply would be lovely) or simply serve with some strong mustard or a brown sharp sauce such as HP. You could also shred the ham and serve it with noodles in a hot broth with some shredded cabbage and other vegetables.The ham is going to be centre of attention - salty, rich with a sweetness. The cabbage and potato are happy bedfellows as the cabbage cuts through the saltyness/sweetness.

Among patients initially converted to organized rhythms, hospital admission rates were lower for patients who refibrillated than for patients who did not(53% versus 76%, P = NS), although discharge rates were virtually identical (37% and 35%, respectively).

Organization of prehospital providers of health care has improved the outcome of many patients, particularly the trauma patient and the acute cardiac patient. In Seattle as many as 40% of outside-the-hospital cardiac arrest victims with ventricular fibrillation have been saved when there is rapid delivery of basic life support by first responders followed by advanced life support by paramedics. Although these systems are growing and improving health care, many lack adequate medical control or physician involvement. Emergency medical service systems must have physicians involved in their management to meet their full capabilities. It has become apparent that four factors are critical in determining the ability to resuscitate an individual once a cardiac arrest has occurred: time to starting any of the rescue procedures, use of electrical defibrillation when indicated, use of epinephrine, and adequacy of the technique of basic life support, particularly the ventilation component. To provide defibrillation at the earliest possible time, defibrillation by first responders such as emergency medical technicians appears to be of benefit. With the advent of automatic and semiautomatic defibrillators, first responders and family members may also be able to defibrillate victims. The use of defibrillation by people with less training than paramedics, however, must be approached with caution to ensure that there is adequate medical control and that the individuals who use these devices are properly trained.",Emergency medical service systems in acute cardiac care.,"Positive.

It has long been known that arterial PO2 (PaO2) decreases during unsupplemented, non- pressurized flight. In this study, the authors examined the use of the transconjunctival oxygen (cjO2) monitor for assessing the adequacy of arterial oxygenation during helicopter flight in four healthy volunteers. Arterial PaO2 as measured by conventional blood gas analysis was compared with cjO2 at ground level, 5,000 feet, and 10,000 feet altitude. Mean PaO2 dropped significantly from 93.5 to 81.5 to 58.5 mm Hg, respectively (P less than 0.001, analysis of variance with repeated measures). Mean cjO2 also decreased significantly from 63.8 to 52.0 to 34.8 mm Hg, respectively (P less than 0.001, analysis of variance with repeated measures). Within individual subjects, cjO2 was an accurate predictor of PaO2 (P less than 0.001, multiple regression analysis). The relationship between cjO2 and PaO2 was linear with a regression coefficient of 1.147. The authors conclude that the transconjunctival O2 monitor may be useful for monitoring the adequacy of arterial oxygenation during helicopter flight in hemodynamically stable patients.

A review of the fetal-maternal carboxyhemoglobin relationships and the differences in fetal oxyhemoglobin physiology are used to explain the recommendation that pregnant women with carbon monoxide poisoning should receive 100% oxygen therapy for up to five times longer than is otherwise necessary. The role of hyperbaric oxygen therapy is considered.,Intraosseous infusion of phenytoin.,"Negative. The title 'Intraosseous infusion of phenytoin.' is no where related to the abstract or present in the abstract. So, it is not a perfect title. The abstract is about pregnency and carbon monoxide poisoning.","Abstract: There is controversy regarding the appropriate utilization of health care resources in the management of tricyclic antidepressant overdosage. Antidepressant overdose patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) are routinely admitted to intensive care units, but only a small proportion develop cardiac arrhythmias or other complications requiring such an environment. The authors reviewed the findings in 165 patients presenting to an ED with antidepressant overdose. They found that major manifestations of toxicity on ED evaluation (altered mental status, seizures, arrhythmias, and conduction defects) were commonly associated with a complicated hospital course. Patients with the isolated findings of sinus tachycardia or QTc prolongation had no complications. No patient experienced a serious toxic event without major evidence of toxicity on ED evaluation and continued evidence of toxicity during the hospital course. These data support the concept that proper ED evaluation can identify a large body of patients with trivial ingestions who may not require hospital observation.",Tricyclic antidepressant overdose: emergency department findings as predictors of clinical course.,,"Abstract: A prospective clinical trial was conducted to estimate the rise in serum glucose level after an intravenous bolus of 50 ml of 50% dextrose solution (D-50) in the emergency department setting. Fifty one subjects with altered levels of consciousness were studied. Of these, 23 patients were known diabetics, and 28 were not diabetic. The change in glucose level for the total study group ranged from a low of 37 mg/dl to a high of 370 mg/dl, with a mean of 166 +/- 77 mg/dl. The mean for the diabetic and non-diabetic groups were 177 +/- 80 mg/dl and 154 +/- 75 mg/dl. These results suggest that serum glucose levels cannot be quantitatively predicted after a single intravenous bolus of D-50.",Serum glucose changes after administration of 50% dextrose solution: pre- and in-hospital calculations.,,"Abstract: An unusual case of a misdirected nasogastric tube is described. An elderly woman was brought to an emergency department following intentional drug overdose. Initially unrecognized errant placement of a large-bore nasogastric tube resulted in tension pneumothorax, pneumonia, and subsequent death. Pertinent medical literature is reviewed, clinical considerations for the elderly patient are discussed, and suggestions for proper nasogastric tube placement are offered.",Nasogastric intubation: morbidity in an asymptomatic patient.,,"Abstract: A case of massive degloving injury of the trunk, with open pelvic fracture, and evisceration of abdominal contents from blunt trauma is presented. The most significant aspect of this case was the transfusion of 173 units of packed cells and 176 units of fresh frozen plasma in the first thirty hours. The patient ultimately recovered and returned to work.",Massive transfusion without major complications after trauma.,,"Abstract: In the critically ill child, administration of fluids and medications via the intraosseous route often proves life-saving. The authors describe the case of a child with status epilepticus in whom phenytoin was administered via the intraosseous route, and seizure resolution and therapeutic serum levels were achieved. Intraosseous drug administration should be reserved for the rare critically ill child in whom vascular access proves impossible.",Intraosseous infusion of phenytoin.,

"Given a paragraph from a Wikipedia article about some topic, and a question related to the topic, determine whether the question is answerable from the paragraph. If the question is answerable, answer ""True"", otherwise, answer ""False"".",Answerability Classification,task1640_aqa1,"Another approach to brain function is to examine the consequences of damage to specific brain areas. Even though it is protected by the skull and meninges, surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid, and isolated from the bloodstream by the blood–brain barrier, the delicate nature of the brain makes it vulnerable to numerous diseases and several types of damage. In humans, the effects of strokes and other types of brain damage have been a key source of information about brain function. Because there is no ability to experimentally control the nature of the damage, however, this information is often difficult to interpret. In animal studies, most commonly involving rats, it is possible to use electrodes or locally injected chemicals to produce precise patterns of damage and then examine the consequences for behavior. Question: What is surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid?",True,Positive. The paragraph comes from the wikipedia page on the brain. The answer to the question is the brain which can be found in the paragraph.,"Motor systems are areas of the brain that are directly or indirectly involved in producing body movements, that is, in activating muscles. Except for the muscles that control the eye, which are driven by nuclei in the midbrain, all the voluntary muscles in the body are directly innervated by motor neurons in the spinal cord and hindbrain. Spinal motor neurons are controlled both by neural circuits intrinsic to the spinal cord, and by inputs that descend from the brain. The intrinsic spinal circuits implement many reflex responses, and contain pattern generators for rhythmic movements such as walking or swimming. The descending connections from the brain allow for more sophisticated control. Question: What is isolated from the bloodstream by the blood-brain barrier?",False,"Positive. The paragraph comes from the wikipedia page on the brain. However, it does not contain the answer to the question.","Devise Minority Party Strategies. The minority leader, in consultation with other party colleagues, has a range of strategic options that he or she can employ to advance minority party objectives. The options selected depend on a wide range of circumstances, such as the visibility or significance of the issue and the degree of cohesion within the majority party. For instance, a majority party riven by internal dissension, as occurred during the early 1900s when Progressive and ""regular"" Republicans were at loggerheads, may provide the minority leader with greater opportunities to achieve his or her priorities than if the majority party exhibited high degrees of party cohesion. Among the variable strategies available to the minority party, which can vary from bill to bill and be used in combination or at different stages of the lawmaking process, are the following. Question: How might a strategy for a minority party member vary?",True,Positive. This paragraph comes from the wikipedia article on Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives. The answer to the question is visibility or significance of the issue and the degree of cohesion within the majority party which can be found in the paragraph.,"NASCAR (headquartered in Daytona Beach) begins all three of its major auto racing series in Florida at Daytona International Speedway in February, featuring the Daytona 500, and ends all three Series in November at Homestead-Miami Speedway.

Out of the 16.0%, 4.0% (741,879) were West Indian or Afro-Caribbean American. During the early 1900s, black people made up nearly half of the state's population. In response to segregation, disfranchisement and agricultural depression, many African Americans migrated from Florida to northern cities in the Great Migration, in waves from 1910 to 1940, and again starting in the later 1940s. They moved for jobs, better education for their children and the chance to vote and participate in society. By 1960 the proportion of African Americans in the state had declined to 18%. Conversely large numbers of northern whites moved to the state.[citation needed] Today, large concentrations of black residents can be found in northern and central Florida. Aside from blacks descended from African slaves brought to the US south, there are also large numbers of blacks of West Indian, recent African, and Afro-Latino immigrant origins, especially in the Miami/South Florida area. In 2010, Florida had the highest percentage of West Indians in the United States, with 2.0% (378,926) from Haitian ancestry, and 1.3% (236,950) Jamaican. All other (non-Hispanic) Caribbean nations were well below 0.1% of Florida residents. Question: Which rule managed the resources of Florida better?",True,"Negative.

Solidaridad Gallega failed, but in 1916 Irmandades da Fala (Brotherhood of the Language) developed first as a cultural association but soon as a full-blown nationalist movement. Vicente Risco and Ramón Otero Pedrayo were outstanding cultural figures of this movement, and the magazine Nós ('Us'), founded 1920, its most notable cultural institution, Lois Peña Novo the outstanding political figure. Question: What is the Galician word for Brotherhood?",True,,"During the period from 1993 to 2011, FBI agents fired their weapons on 289 occasions; FBI internal reviews found the shots justified in all but 5 cases, in none of the 5 cases were people wounded. Samuel Walker, a professor of criminal justice at the University of Nebraska Omaha said the number of shots found to be unjustified was ""suspiciously low."" In the same time period, the FBI wounded 150 people, 70 of whom died; the FBI found all 150 shootings to be justified. Likewise, during the period from 2011 to the present, all shootings by FBI agents have been found to be justified by internal investigation. In a 2002 case in Maryland, an innocent man was shot, and later paid $1.3 million by the FBI after agents mistook him for a bank robber; the internal investigation found that the shooting was justified, based on the man's actions. Question: What are the main types of analysis completed by the FBI Laboratory?",False,,"Early releases of the Washington coin included error coins shipped primarily from the Philadelphia mint to Florida and Tennessee banks. Highly sought after by collectors, and trading for as much as $850 each within a week of discovery, the error coins were identified by the absence of the edge impressions ""E PLURIBUS UNUM IN GOD WE TRUST 2007 P"". The mint of origin is generally accepted to be mostly Philadelphia, although identifying the source mint is impossible without opening a mint pack also containing marked units. Edge lettering is minted in both orientations with respect to ""heads"", some amateur collectors were initially duped into buying ""upside down lettering error"" coins. Some cynics also erroneously point out that the Federal Reserve makes more profit from dollar bills than dollar coins because they wear out in a few years, whereas coins are more permanent. The fallacy of this argument arises because new notes printed to replace worn out notes, which have been withdrawn from circulation, bring in no net revenue to the government to offset the costs of printing new notes and destroying the old ones. As most vending machines are incapable of making change in banknotes, they commonly accept only $1 bills, though a few will give change in dollar coins. Question: How were some collectors fooled when seeking error coins?",True,,"The finale is the two-hour last episode of the season, culminating in revealing the winner. For seasons one, three through six, and fourteen, it was broadcast from the Dolby Theatre, which has an audience capacity of approximately 3,400.
