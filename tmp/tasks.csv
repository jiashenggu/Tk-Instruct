Her comments were criticised by a Labour AM. Alun Davies said threatening legal action ""sounds like the last breath before you're thrown out of the pub"". Mr Davies said he was not convinced the Welsh Government would ""have a leg to stand on"" in trying to shape international trade deals after Brexit. Following Donald Trump's comments during last week's trade visit that the NHS would be ""on the table"" in any future trade talks between the UK and the USA, Eluned Morgan said there was ""absolutely no prospect whatsoever of us allowing the Welsh NHS to be part of any negotiation."" The US President then rowed back on his initial comments following criticism from a number of MPs. Asked about her response to President Trump's remarks as she gave evidence to the Assembly's Brexit committee on Monday, Ms Morgan said ""legally, it would be difficult for us to stop because we don't have a veto over trade"". ""Politically, I think it's extremely unlikely to happen,"" the international relations and the Welsh language minister said. ""They [the UK Government] should not be concluding any trade agreements without consulting us where we have the power."" Ms Morgan explained that UK and Welsh government officials are working on an agreement or 'concordat' for how future trade deals are negotiated. During a robust exchange, the Labour AM Alun Davies said: ""I want something which is in law to which I can hold you to account and which colleagues in Westminster can hold the UK Government to account. ""The argument we'll make life difficult for them, it sounds alright on the street, but it's not the reality of intergovernmental relations."" ""The United Kingdom has to find a way of functioning. ""At the moment, your answers aren't giving me any confidence that there is that structure in place because, if the Welsh Government's argument is, 'we'll see you in court', it's not a very impressive argument either for the continuation of the structure of United Kingdom as a state or the commitment of the government within the United Kingdom to actually work together,"" he added. Responding to the criticism, Ms Morgan said: ""Is the current intergovernmental structure adequate? ""Absolutely not... and it's not just in relation to trade, it's in relation to almost every aspect of government policy. So, that infrastructure needs to be built.""",NHS Wales: Court action if trade deals affect service?,Positive.

The gas is inhaled using a balloon. Russian investigators reported the deaths, without naming the pair, and said there were no signs of foul play. Bogdanovich was a speed chess champion. Vernigora was also a professional chess player and was studying at Moscow State University. The Ukrainian sports website sport.ua says Bogdanovich was a grandmaster from Odessa who won the Ukrainian Under-18 championship and various chess awards at international tournaments. Russian chess website chess-news.ru says that in 2015 he was rated eighth in the world for speed (blitz) chess. Reports say Bogdanovich drew much criticism recently for representing Russia in an internet chess match against Ukraine, which he won. Sport.ua quotes a Facebook post from him (in Russian) about that, in which he argued that playing for Russia was good for business, that he was living as a guest in Russia and being treated well, and this was his small contribution to ending the Russia-Ukraine conflict.

The result has been described as a ""superb lift"" for the spa town. Work to rip up the club's artificial pitch and replace it with grass, in keeping with league regulations, is expected to start later on Monday. Fan Brody Pattison joked that he wanted some of the artificial pitch in his back garden as a souvenir. He said: ""I can't thank the players enough, they're all heroes for this town, they're going to go down in history. ""We've come so far as a club in the last three or four years, we're a small town full of teashops and we're in the Football League."" Another Sulphurites supporter, Jack Wilkinson, said he woke up on Monday with a bottle of champagne and a huge sign saying ""we're going to Wembley"". He said: ""As soon as they scored the first goal, that's when the tears started and they didn't stop until full-time, I'm a grown adult crying over a football match. ""It makes the early mornings going to Dover, Yeovil, Torquay all worth it."" The Sulphurites also won the praise of what is possibly Harrogate's most famous institution, Bettys tearoom. A spokeswoman said: ""We've the kettle on and Fat Rascals (a kind of scone) in the oven. We're delighted to raise a toast to Simon Weaver and the winning Harrogate team."" Harrogate businessman Mark Noble was lucky enough to attend the game as a guest of the club. He said: ""The lads were all so proud, the support they've had all season was with them yesterday, the flags were up. ""Yesterday was a large key opening a large door, next season we're in that room and hopefully when Covid is over, all the supporters will all be there following the team."" Simon Cotton, who runs hotels and pubs in and around the town, said promotion was a ""superb lift"" for Harrogate after ""so many months of lockdown blues"". He said: ""Harrogate relies on visitor tourism and if more fans are travelling to see their teams then they're potentially going to stay in hotels in the town, go for a drink in the bars, have something to eat in the restaurants and buy something in the shops."" There have been calls for an open-top bus parade, although coronavirus restrictions mean this is unlikely. Harrogate Borough mayor Stuart Martin said: ""We've got to try and think of how best we can celebrate - under normal circumstances, wouldn't it have been nice to have a civic reception for them? - but there's no way we can do that under the current climate, it's just not feasible."" He said promotion was ""going to bring a real buzz to the town, to the district, to the county"" and would encourage more youngsters to get involved in sport. Lindsey Whitton, captain of Harrogate Town's women's team, said she hoped the club's recent success would inspire more girls to start playing football. She said: ""It's amazing, the profile of the club has just risen so much within 24 hours, not only for the men's team but it's going to have a massive impact on the women's team, the player development centre, the academy.""

About 40 houses in the St Conal's Square area of Kirkconnel were evacuated and a rest and welfare centre has been set up at the village's Miners Hall. Police said the village of Moniaive was almost cut off at one point due to flooding on the A702, and a family had to be evacuated from a bungalow which was cut off by flood water. Firefighters used rescue boats to assist with the evacuations. Homes in Port Logan and Newton Stewart also had to be evacuated.

Information technology (IT) equipment and trips and outings are also being scaled back, it suggested. The government said school funding was at record levels. IT equipment is being cut back by 35% of primaries and 38% of secondaries, the survey of 1,361 teachers by the National Foundation for Educational Research found. Outings and trips are being affected in nearly a third of schools - 30% of primary and 32% of secondary schools. Pupil premium The poll also suggested some schools are using funding for disadvantaged pupils (the pupil premium) to subsidise the school budget. Of the 420 senior leaders who took part in the survey, 32% of primary and 27% of secondary senior staff say the pupil premium is being used to plug gaps elsewhere in the school's budget. Sir Peter Lampl, founder and chairman of the Sutton Trust and chairman of the Education Endowment Foundation, said: ""Our new polling adds to the growing evidence from highly credible sources that the squeeze on school budgets is having a detrimental effect on schools. ""Many are having to get rid of teachers to close these funding gaps. ""Of particular concern is that schools are having to use funding for poorer pupils to plug gaps in their finances. ""The pupil premium should be used for highly cost-effective interventions such as peer tutoring and pupil feedback.""

One key advantage, Intel says, is that users will be able to see their own hands. It intends to offer the technology to other manufactures next year, but will not sell the headsets itself. The company is keen to avoid repeating the mistake it made with smartphones. The California-based company has previously acknowledged that it botched an opportunity to supply Apple with chips for its original iPhone. It subsequently lost out to rival ARM-based technology that now powers the vast majority of handsets. Project Alloy marks an opportunity to pitch its RealSense depth-sensing cameras, Replay graphics-creation software and other proprietary inventions to others before virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) devices - which superimpose graphics over a real-world view - go mainstream. Even so, it is far from being the only technology giant involved in the sector: Furthermore, AMD - a rival chipmaker to Intel - is developing an untethered headset of its own that mixes together AR and VR technologies. No cord or controller Intel's chief executive, Brian Krzanich, offered a first look at Project Alloy at his company's developer forum in San Francisco, where he suggested the technology could ""redefine what is possible with computing"". One of the benefits of its approach, he said, was that the headset's RealSense cameras could detect a user's finger movements and allow them to appear in a virtual world and manipulate simulated objects. ""Merged reality is about more natural ways of interacting with and manipulating virtual environments,"" he said in a blog later published on Medium. ""[That liberates] you from the controllers and the nunchucks of today's VR systems by immersing your hands - your real-life hands - into your simulated experiences."" In an on-stage demonstration, the hands could be seen only if they were held near to the centre of the user's field of view. When Mr Krzanich's own face appeared within the VR world, it also became apparent that ""merged reality"" objects only appeared as low resolution graphics, at least for now. He added that the technology had benefits over rival systems that required a user to install external sensors in their room to detect their movements. And he suggested that going wireless would prevent an owner being ""jolted"" out of their experience because they had reached the limit of the cord used to transmit data from a PC or games console. However, he acknowledged that one trade-off would be that the computer involved would take slightly longer to respond to a user's actions - something that might concern gamers. Virtual advances Microsoft has pledged to support the headset in a forthcoming version of Windows 10. One expert said Project Alloy had promise, but it might only have limited appeal. ""Having a real-time rendition of your hands or other objects in VR could have appeal to enterprise applications, such as a surgeon training with a body diagram or a mechanic having graphics overlaid onto an engine part,"" said Ed Barton, from the technology consultancy Ovum. ""But when it comes to gaming, there hasn't been much clamour to be able to see your hands in real-time. ""Vive, for example, has addressed the issue with special controllers. It's not something that people have been crying out for."" The unveiling of Project Alloy comes seven months after Intel disclosed some of its other VR and AR efforts. At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, it showed off an augmented reality helmet for construction workers, made by the start-up Daqri, and a smartphone virtual reality accessory made by IonVR. Both incorporated its RealSense sensors.",Intel unveils Project Alloy 'merged reality' headset,,"New Zealand-born Sgt Ratana, known as Matt, was shot in the chest in Croydon as a suspect, who was still in handcuffs, was being checked in. Met Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick described the 54-year-old as ""talented officer"" who was ""big in heart"". After the shooting at about 02:15 BST the suspect, 23, is then thought to have shot himself. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said the man was arrested on suspicion of possession of Class B drugs with intent to supply and possession of ammunition. He is currently in a critical condition in hospital. The IOPC confirmed he was handcuffed with his hands behind his back and had been taken to the custody centre in a police vehicle, before being escorted into the building. The shots were fired as officers prepared to search the suspect, who was still handcuffed, with a metal detector, the IOPC said. ""A non-police issue firearm, which appears to be a revolver, has been recovered from the scene. Further ballistic work will be required,"" said IOPC regional director Sal Naseem. A minute's silence was held at 16:00 BST at New Scotland Yard and Croydon Police Station to pay tribute to Sgt Ratana, who was heavily involved in rugby coaching when he was not working. He would have been eligible for retirement in just two months. ""Matt spent very nearly 30 years as a uniformed police officer serving the public of London,"" said Dame Cressida. ""He will be remembered so fondly in Croydon and missed there, as well as in the Met and the rugby world,"" she said. She added that he ""leaves a partner and he leaves an adult son from a previous relationship. Our thoughts are with them."" Sgt Ratana joined the Met in 1991, having moved to the UK in 1989. He was originally from the Hawke's Bay area of New Zealand and was educated at Palmerston North Boy's High School's, a town north of the capital, Wellington. He served in various parts of London including Hackney and Selhurst, with his last posting as custody sergeant in Croydon, where he managed suspects who are brought into the cells. ""He worked in our detention command at Croydon but frequently volunteered for duty in custody suites across London,"" Dame Cressida added. Sgt Ratana had led rugby teams in Worthing, close to Goring-by-Sea where he then lived and in East Grinstead, where he was living when he died. Ryan Morlen, assistant head coach at East Grinstead Rugby Club, described him as ""an absolutely lovely bloke"". ""He is a bloke who is just so passionate about what he does - it does not matter whether you're the most talented or least talented, he will treat you equal,"" he said. Earlier, BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said it was believed the suspect was known to counter-terrorism police. He had been referred to the anti-extremism ""Prevent"" programme, though the Met said the murder inquiry was not being treated as terrorism-related. The Met said a murder investigation was under way, but the shooting was not being treated as a counter-terrorism incident. Dame Cressida said she understood ""the great concern about how this happened"" and that officers ""will establish the facts"". ""We owe it to Matt, his loved ones and all other officers. But we need to give investigators space to do their job,"" she said. London's Mayor Sadiq Khan earlier said the police were currently ""reviewing the safety of custody suites"" and ""there could be changes very soon"". Police officers and members of the public have been arriving at Croydon Police Station during the day to lay tributes. The owner of a gym in Lancing, Sussex, told the BBC how Sgt Ratana had helped when his business was going through financial difficulty. Neil Donohue, 54, said: ""He came in one day and gave me 200 quid out of the blue, I said no no, I can't accept that and gave it back to him. ""But the next day he wired it into my account. That's the sort of guy he was."" A number of police officers have been turning their social media profile pictures black with a blue stripe to pay their respects. John Davies, a retired officer who worked with Sgt Ratana when he was based in Hillingdon, said he was ""a truly remarkable, strong and unique individual"" who ""left an impression on all those he came into contact with"". East Grinstead RFC also released a tribute to their ""much-loved"" head coach.

 Hypothesis: Lyme disease is caused by bacteria.",entails,Positive. The premise sentence agrees with the hypothesis that Lyme Disease is a bacterium. The premise also gives additional information about Lyme disease. Therefore Premise entails Hypothesis.,"Premise: Corolla Collective term for all the petals of a flower, these petals may be separate or fused together. 
 Hypothesis: All of the petals together are called a corolla.",entails,"Positive. The premise sentence explains the meaning of Corolla. The hypothesis sentence is explained by the Premise. Since the premise supports/entails the Hypothesis, this is classified as entails.","Premise: This can be dangerous to both plants and animals. 
 Hypothesis: Nematodes can be a parasite of both.",neutral,Positive. The premise misses the context to the word 'this'. Therefore it is incomplete. The hypothesis is not supporting the premise. Therefore it is classified as neutral.,"Premise: The liver is divided into the right lobe and left lobes. 
 Hypothesis: The gallbladder is near the right lobe of the liver.",neutral,Positive. The premise states about the general structure of the liver while the hypothesis is explaining about a specific part of the liver. Therefore this premise does not support the hypothesis and hence classified as neutral.,"Premise: A polyploid is simply an organism that contains more than the usual two sets of chromosomes.  
 Hypothesis: A(n) polyploid is an individual with more than the correct number of chromosome sets.",neutral,"Negative. The premise explains the meaning of the term and the hypothesis sentence also specifies it correctly. Because the Premise supports the Hypothesis, this is classifies should be classified as entails not as neutral.","Premise: Based on the list provided of the uses of substances 1-7, estimate the pH of each unknown and record the number in the data table in the estimated pH column. 
 Hypothesis: If a substance has a ph value greater than 7, that indicates that it is based.",entails,Negative. The premise does not have a fact that can be supported. It is a task that should be carried out to find the pH of the substances. The hypothesis is therefore not supported by the premise. It should be classified as neutral not as entails.,"Premise: The phylum for common marigolds is angiosperms. 
 Hypothesis: Angiosperms are the most successful phylum of plants.",entails,"Negative. The premise states the name for Marigold specifically. Since the hypothesis mentions this as successful phylum and gives no information about marigold being successful or not, this should be classified as neutral.","Premise: Vertebrates are named for vertebrae, the series of bones that make up the vertebral column or backbone. 
 Hypothesis: Backbone is another name for the vertebral column.",neutral,Negative. The usage of the word 'or' between the words vertebral column and backbone implies that both the names are the same. The same meaning is conveyed in the Hypothesis too. Therefore this should be classified as entails and not as neutral.,"Premise: As threats to bird populations grow and extinctions continue, historical specimens are valuable in documenting the impacts of human activities and causes of decline for threatened species. 
 Hypothesis: Around 1200 species of birds are currently at risk of extinction due to human activity.",neutral,,"Premise: The hagfish has no cerebrum  or cerebellum, no jaws and no stomach, and its skeleton is made up by cartilage  instead of bones.

Efforts to control future SARS outbreaks depend on the accurate and early identification of SARS-CoV infected patients. A real-time fluorogenic RT-PCR assay based on the 3 -noncoding region (3 -NCR) of SARS-CoV genome was developed as a quantitative SARS diagnostic tool. The ideal amplification efficiency of a sensitive SARS-CoV RT-PCR assay should yield an E value (PCR product concentration increase per amplification cycle) equal to 2.0. It was demonstrated that the 3 -NCR SARS-CoV based RT-PCR reactions could be formulated to reach excellent E values of 1.81, or 91% amplification efficacy. The SARS-CoV cDNA preparations derived from viral RNA extract and the cloned recombinant plasmid both exhibit the identical amplification characteristics, i.e. amplification efficacy using the same PCR formulation developed in this study. The viral genomic copy (or genomic equivalences, GE) per infectious unit (GE/pfu) of SARS-CoV used in this study was also established to be approximate 1200-1600:1. The assay's detection sensitivity could reach 0.005 pfu or 6-8 GE per assay. It was preliminarily demonstrated that the assay could efficiently detect SARS-CoV from clinical specimens of SARS probable and suspected patients identified in Taiwan.

To prevent the next epidemic and pandemic related to these interfaces, we call for research and investment in three areas: 1) surveillance among wildlife to identify the high-risk pathogens they carry; 2) surveillance among people who have contact with wildlife to identify early spillover events; and 3) improvement of market biosecurity regarding the wildlife trade. As the emergence of a novel virus anywhere can impact the furthest reaches of our connected world, international collaboration among scientists is essential to address these risks and prevent the next pandemic.",A strategy to prevent future epidemics similar to the 2019-nCoV outbreak,Positive.

Ascending infections caused by sexually transmitted bacteria or urinary tract pathogens represent the most frequent aetiology of epididymo-orchitis, but viral, haematogenous dissemination is also a contributory factor. Limitations in adequate diagnosis and therapy reflect an obvious need for further understanding of human epididymal and testicular immunopathologies and their contribution to infertility. A major obstacle for advancing our knowledge is the limited access to suitable tissue samples. Similarly, the key events in the inflammatory or autoimmune pathologies affecting human male fertility are poorly amenable to close examination. Moreover, the disease processes generally have occurred long before the patient attends the clinic for fertility assessment. In this regard, data obtained from experimental animal models and respective comparative analyses have shown promise to overcome these restrictions in humans.",dsRNA sensors and plasmacytoid dendritic cells in host defense and autoimmunity The primary response to viral detection: type I interferons,"Negative.

This paper presents the numerical analysis of the human respiration process and the transport of exhaled air by breathing, sneezing, and coughing and their potential impact on the adjacent person in a modeled room with displacement ventilation. In order to account for the influence of the thermal plume around the human body, a three-dimensional computational thermal manikin (CTM) with an accurate description of body geometry was applied. Some of the results were compared with those from former simulations and experiments. It was found that personal exposure to the exhaled air from the normal respiration process of other persons is very low in a modeled room with displacement ventilation. Personal exposure to pollution caused by sneezing or coughing is highly directional. When two occupants face each other the cross-infection may happen due to the long transport distance of the exhalation.",Association of Cytokines in Individuals Sensitive and Insensitive to Dust Mites in a Brazilian Population,Negative.

Genetic PAP (GPAP) is caused by mutations in genes encoding surfactant proteins or genes encoding a surfactant phospholipid transporter in alveolar type II epithelial cells. GPAP is also caused by mutations in genes whose products are implicated in surfactant catabolism in alveolar macrophages (AMs). We performed whole-exome sequence analysis in a family affected by infantile-onset PAP with hypogammaglobulinemia without causative mutations in genes associated with PAP: SFTPB, SFTPC, ABCA3, CSF2RA, CSF2RB, and GATA2. We identified a heterozygous missense variation in OAS1, encoding 2, 0 5 0 -oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1) in three affected siblings, but not in unaffected family members. Deep sequence analysis with next-generation sequencing indicated 3.81% mosaicism of this variant in DNA from their mother's peripheral blood leukocytes, suggesting that PAP observed in this family could be inherited as an autosomal-dominant trait from the mother. We identified two additional de novo heterozygous missense variations of OAS1 in two unrelated simplex individuals also manifesting infantile-onset PAP with hypogammaglobulinemia. PAP in the two simplex individuals resolved after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, indicating that OAS1 dysfunction is associated with impaired surfactant catabolism due to the defects in AMs.",Heterozygous Mutations in OAS1 Cause Infantile-Onset Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis with Hypogammaglobulinemia,,"Newcastle disease (ND) is a contagious disease that affects most species of birds. Its causative pathogen, Newcastle disease virus (NDV), also exhibits considerable oncolytic activity against mammalian cancers. A better understanding of the pathogenesis of NDV will help us design efficient vaccines and novel anticancer strategies. GW3965, a widely used synthetic ligand of liver X receptor (LXR), induces the expression of LXRs and its downstream genes, including ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1). ABCA1 regulates cellular cholesterol homeostasis. Here, we found that GW3965 inhibited NDV infection in DF-1 cells. It also inhibited NF-jB activation and reduced the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines induced by the infection. Further studies showed that GW3965 exerted its inhibitory effects on virus entry and replication. NDV infection increased the mRNA levels of several lipogenic genes but decreased the ABCA1 mRNA level. Overexpression of ABCA1 inhibited NDV infection and reduced the cholesterol content in DF-1 cells, but when the cholesterol was replenished, NDV infection was restored. GW3965 treatment prevented cholesterol accumulation in the perinuclear area of the infected cells. In summary, our studies suggest that GW3965 inhibits NDV infection, probably by affecting cholesterol homeostasis.",The LXR ligand GW3965 inhibits Newcastle disease virus infection by affecting cholesterol homeostasis,,"Objectives: The present study aimed to examine the trends and characteristics of fall-related attendance in accident and emergency department (AED) by injury type and the trend in associated average length of stay (LOS) among children and adolescents in Hong Kong. Design: A retrospective approach was adopted. Setting: AED, involving all local public emergency departments from 2001 to 2012. Participants: 63 557 subjects aged 0-19 years with fall injury record were included in the analysis. Primary outcome measures: Fall-related injury number and rates were calculated and reported. Poisson and negative binomial regression models were used to study the trends of injury incidence rate at different body regions. Results: AED fall-related attendance rate increased significantly with an annual percentage change of 4.45 (95% CI 3.43 to 5.47%, p<0.0001). The attendance number of male subjects was persistently higher than female subjects. The standardised rate of fracture injury increased by 1.31% (95% CI 0.56 to 2.05%, p<0.0001) and that of non-fracture injury increased by 9.23% (95% CI 7.07 to 11.43%, p<0.0001) annually. Upper limb was the most frequently fractured location. It included forearm/elbow, shoulder/upper arm and wrist/hand with descending order of frequency. On the contrary, head was the most frequent non-fracture location, followed by forearm/elbow. The rates of fall-related attendance have been increasing and still remain high. There were significant increases in non-fracture injuries. Fractures were most frequently found in the upper extremity of a child while the most common non-fracture location was head.

Random amplification of partially purified vitreous fluid (VF)-derived nucleic acid revealed the presence of human anelloviruses in VF of SHAPU patients. In a comparative study of patients with different ocular pathologies, SHAPU patients were at highest risk of harboring anelloviruses in their eyes. The majority of SHAPU patients had multiple anelloviruses in their VF. The ocular anellovirus load in SHAPU and non-SHAPU patients did not differ and no SHAPU-specific anellovirus variant was detected. Analysis of paired serum and VF samples from SHAPU and non-SHAPU patients showed that the anellovirus detected in VF samples most likely originated from the systemic viral pool during viremia, potentially through breakdown of the blood-ocular barrier. The detection of anelloviruses in VF samples of uveitis patients, profoundly so in SHAPU patients, is imperative and warrants elucidation of its clinical significance.",High Prevalence of Anelloviruses in Vitreous Fluid of Children With Seasonal Hyperacute Panuveitis,

Any bird's feet are a good choice.The method for making stock is pretty much the same no matter what you put into it, so yes, you can follow your favourite recipe for chicken stock and substitute duck feet. The only thing to keep in mind is that duck feet, like any other duck parts, are substantially more fatty than their chicken equivalents, so assuming you want a clear or mostly-clear stock, you'll have to spend a lot of time skimming.Alternatively you can clean the feet and other bones by boiling them in plain water for 5-10 minutes, then dumping it all out and starting over - which is what your linked recipe suggests. I don't usually do this for brown stocks because you lose a lot of flavour, but if you're starting from raw then it won't make much difference and it's an easy/lazy way to get rid of a lot of the fat at once. <sep> Q: Can I use duck feet to make duck stock A: The method for making stock is pretty much the same no matter what you put into it, so yes, you can follow your favourite recipe for chicken stock and substitute duck feet  Q: Does it add the same flavor and mouth feel?

Traditionally it's had with cut up cabbage (ideally you would cook the cabbage in the same water the ham was boiled in as this gives it lovely flavour) but you could just cut it up and pan fry it with a little butter. Normally it would be served with boiled floury potatoes. Traditionally (in Ireland) you wouldn't have a sauce with it but a parsely sauce (as stated in the other reply would be lovely) or simply serve with some strong mustard or a brown sharp sauce such as HP. You could also shred the ham and serve it with noodles in a hot broth with some shredded cabbage and other vegetables.The ham is going to be centre of attention - salty, rich with a sweetness. The cabbage and potato are happy bedfellows as the cabbage cuts through the saltyness/sweetness.

Organization of prehospital providers of health care has improved the outcome of many patients, particularly the trauma patient and the acute cardiac patient. In Seattle as many as 40% of outside-the-hospital cardiac arrest victims with ventricular fibrillation have been saved when there is rapid delivery of basic life support by first responders followed by advanced life support by paramedics. Although these systems are growing and improving health care, many lack adequate medical control or physician involvement. Emergency medical service systems must have physicians involved in their management to meet their full capabilities. It has become apparent that four factors are critical in determining the ability to resuscitate an individual once a cardiac arrest has occurred: time to starting any of the rescue procedures, use of electrical defibrillation when indicated, use of epinephrine, and adequacy of the technique of basic life support, particularly the ventilation component. To provide defibrillation at the earliest possible time, defibrillation by first responders such as emergency medical technicians appears to be of benefit. With the advent of automatic and semiautomatic defibrillators, first responders and family members may also be able to defibrillate victims. The use of defibrillation by people with less training than paramedics, however, must be approached with caution to ensure that there is adequate medical control and that the individuals who use these devices are properly trained.",Emergency medical service systems in acute cardiac care.,"Positive.

It has long been known that arterial PO2 (PaO2) decreases during unsupplemented, non- pressurized flight. In this study, the authors examined the use of the transconjunctival oxygen (cjO2) monitor for assessing the adequacy of arterial oxygenation during helicopter flight in four healthy volunteers. Arterial PaO2 as measured by conventional blood gas analysis was compared with cjO2 at ground level, 5,000 feet, and 10,000 feet altitude. Mean PaO2 dropped significantly from 93.5 to 81.5 to 58.5 mm Hg, respectively (P less than 0.001, analysis of variance with repeated measures). Mean cjO2 also decreased significantly from 63.8 to 52.0 to 34.8 mm Hg, respectively (P less than 0.001, analysis of variance with repeated measures). Within individual subjects, cjO2 was an accurate predictor of PaO2 (P less than 0.001, multiple regression analysis).

The change in glucose level for the total study group ranged from a low of 37 mg/dl to a high of 370 mg/dl, with a mean of 166 +/- 77 mg/dl. The mean for the diabetic and non-diabetic groups were 177 +/- 80 mg/dl and 154 +/- 75 mg/dl.

Even though it is protected by the skull and meninges, surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid, and isolated from the bloodstream by the blood–brain barrier, the delicate nature of the brain makes it vulnerable to numerous diseases and several types of damage. In humans, the effects of strokes and other types of brain damage have been a key source of information about brain function. Because there is no ability to experimentally control the nature of the damage, however, this information is often difficult to interpret. In animal studies, most commonly involving rats, it is possible to use electrodes or locally injected chemicals to produce precise patterns of damage and then examine the consequences for behavior. Question: What is surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid?",True,Positive. The paragraph comes from the wikipedia page on the brain. The answer to the question is the brain which can be found in the paragraph.,"Motor systems are areas of the brain that are directly or indirectly involved in producing body movements, that is, in activating muscles. Except for the muscles that control the eye, which are driven by nuclei in the midbrain, all the voluntary muscles in the body are directly innervated by motor neurons in the spinal cord and hindbrain. Spinal motor neurons are controlled both by neural circuits intrinsic to the spinal cord, and by inputs that descend from the brain. The intrinsic spinal circuits implement many reflex responses, and contain pattern generators for rhythmic movements such as walking or swimming. The descending connections from the brain allow for more sophisticated control. Question: What is isolated from the bloodstream by the blood-brain barrier?",False,"Positive. The paragraph comes from the wikipedia page on the brain. However, it does not contain the answer to the question.","Devise Minority Party Strategies. The minority leader, in consultation with other party colleagues, has a range of strategic options that he or she can employ to advance minority party objectives. The options selected depend on a wide range of circumstances, such as the visibility or significance of the issue and the degree of cohesion within the majority party. For instance, a majority party riven by internal dissension, as occurred during the early 1900s when Progressive and ""regular"" Republicans were at loggerheads, may provide the minority leader with greater opportunities to achieve his or her priorities than if the majority party exhibited high degrees of party cohesion. Among the variable strategies available to the minority party, which can vary from bill to bill and be used in combination or at different stages of the lawmaking process, are the following. Question: How might a strategy for a minority party member vary?",True,Positive. This paragraph comes from the wikipedia article on Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives.

Out of the 16.0%, 4.0% (741,879) were West Indian or Afro-Caribbean American. During the early 1900s, black people made up nearly half of the state's population. In response to segregation, disfranchisement and agricultural depression, many African Americans migrated from Florida to northern cities in the Great Migration, in waves from 1910 to 1940, and again starting in the later 1940s. They moved for jobs, better education for their children and the chance to vote and participate in society. By 1960 the proportion of African Americans in the state had declined to 18%. Conversely large numbers of northern whites moved to the state.[citation needed] Today, large concentrations of black residents can be found in northern and central Florida. Aside from blacks descended from African slaves brought to the US south, there are also large numbers of blacks of West Indian, recent African, and Afro-Latino immigrant origins, especially in the Miami/South Florida area. In 2010, Florida had the highest percentage of West Indians in the United States, with 2.0% (378,926) from Haitian ancestry, and 1.3% (236,950) Jamaican.

Samuel Walker, a professor of criminal justice at the University of Nebraska Omaha said the number of shots found to be unjustified was ""suspiciously low."" In the same time period, the FBI wounded 150 people, 70 of whom died; the FBI found all 150 shootings to be justified. Likewise, during the period from 2011 to the present, all shootings by FBI agents have been found to be justified by internal investigation. In a 2002 case in Maryland, an innocent man was shot, and later paid $1.3 million by the FBI after agents mistook him for a bank robber; the internal investigation found that the shooting was justified, based on the man's actions. Question: What are the main types of analysis completed by the FBI Laboratory?",False,,"Early releases of the Washington coin included error coins shipped primarily from the Philadelphia mint to Florida and Tennessee banks. Highly sought after by collectors, and trading for as much as $850 each within a week of discovery, the error coins were identified by the absence of the edge impressions ""E PLURIBUS UNUM IN GOD WE TRUST 2007 P"". The mint of origin is generally accepted to be mostly Philadelphia, although identifying the source mint is impossible without opening a mint pack also containing marked units. Edge lettering is minted in both orientations with respect to ""heads"", some amateur collectors were initially duped into buying ""upside down lettering error"" coins. Some cynics also erroneously point out that the Federal Reserve makes more profit from dollar bills than dollar coins because they wear out in a few years, whereas coins are more permanent. The fallacy of this argument arises because new notes printed to replace worn out notes, which have been withdrawn from circulation, bring in no net revenue to the government to offset the costs of printing new notes and destroying the old ones. As most vending machines are incapable of making change in banknotes, they commonly accept only $1 bills, though a few will give change in dollar coins.

MGBG, 500 mg/M2, was administered as a brief intravenous infusion weekly for 4 weeks, then every 2 weeks. Dose modifications were based on cumulative toxicity after 2 weekly treatments. All but three patients had prior exposure to chemotherapy for disease recurrence. Of 17 patients evaluable for response and toxicity, one brief partial response was observed. The most common toxicities were mild to moderate nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and stomatitis. Myelosuppression occurred in three patients. Dose modifications were required in four patients; a maximum dose of 700 mg/M2 was tolerated. The results of four other Phase II single and combination chemotherapy trials of MGBG in head and neck cancer are reviewed. The single agent response rate in 59 patients was 22% (range, 6%-41%). The poor response rate observed in this trial was similar to that in other trials in which a heavily pretreated group of patients was evaluated. It is concluded that single agent MGBG is not a useful drug in heavily pretreated recurrent disease patients.

This week I've been making scrambled eggs (american style), toast and avocado with -&gt; FRESH PARSLEY &lt;- sprinkled on top of the eggs.

Every morning this week I've woken up my roommate with a really really pleasant surprise of home cooked food. He always acts really grateful, and I'm happy to do it because I enjoy making food... However. After cleaning the plates today I noticed that he had hid ALL of the parsley I had sprinkled on his eggs under his cup.

Parsley goes with eggs. He's making his morning experience WORSE by eating around it... and then trying to hide the evidence- WEIRD MUCH??

So tomorrow I am going to put more parsley on the eggs I make. I'm actually going to put more on than I put yesterday. So yeah. Sorry if this is the wrong format but can you just honestly tell me if I am the asshole in this situation?? I will update this post as developments happen.",preparing breakfast for my roommate,"Negative. The event of adding more parsley is the root cause of the ethical situation. This is because, it is clear that in future, the author will attempt to put more parsley in roommate's breakfast being aware that he doesn't like parsley. So even though preparing breakfast is a relevant action, it is not the exact event which raises the situation.","My mom suggested instead of Christmas presents we donate it all to charities, specifically helping the fire victims here in CA. I budgeted my holiday spending anticipating clothes and cooking supplies from them, and I would rather get the tax deduction than them if/when I donate to help.

It doesn't help that I'm the only Democrat and me feeling like a hypocrite for not wanting this. ",I'm the only Democrat,Negative. The author's political affiliation is not important here.

My current xbox is the same type as his and actually better for some reason (mine has a matte finish, his a plastic. Mine disc reader hasn't broken yet for some reason his has etc.) So I want to give him mine and replace the one I'm giving him with a newer model.

We have been dating about a month and it's the most amazing relationship I've ever been in. He's kind, he's generous, he's in great shape and he has none of the insecurities I've encountered in other guys.

My parents are about to flip out and cut me off. My mom even called me a sugar baby and my dad isn't speaking to me at all. I feel they've made commitments to me but never stipulated that they can control my behavior with them. 

Am I the asshole here?",dating a man 28 years older than me? my parents are coming apart at the seams,,"I'm asking because I genuinely have no idea whether I'm doing the right thing. 

My sister has mental health issues that are particularly ill at evening and night-time. I've been there for her for months, but tonight I just didn't have the energy. She has called me a few times tonight and flat-out asked if I can come over to help, but for the first time, I have said I need some rest and to get some work done.

I've moved back home with my parents to help her, and she lives in her own apartment in the same building. There are only two people that calm her down (to some extent), and that is me and my brother. My brother can't be there for her because he is going through a lot too, and is battling his own mind.

She is in treatment 3 times every week, but it hasn't helped. She has been severely depressed for over 10 years, and it only continues to get worse.

A normal night will start with us playing games, but she will gradually become hysterical. This happens every single night. She begins with becoming hyper, then hysterical, and then become delirious. A regular night involves self-harming in front of me, running outside to hurt herself, locking herself into the bathroom with medicines or a knife, being aggressive and violent towards me, crying hysterically and over-eating. It's clear that she is just looking for an outlet. She feels so hysterical and desperate, but nothing seems to give her peace... 

I don't know what to do, but I have no more energy. It just doesn't get better, and I think she needs professional help. The doctors believe she is in the right treatment, but I can't see any improvement. I'm certain she will hurt herself tonight while I'm gone, and worried she will do something worse. I don't know what to do, but I have nothing more to give.   


Still, it makes me feel like an asshole to not be there for her even though she is suicidal, should I pull myself together and go another mile? I can hear her crying hysterically through the wall, but I'm just sitting here enjoying a few hours of my own company.",not visiting my mentally ill sister,,"My ex and I dated a long time (like 7 years) and then my ex broke up with me unexpectedly. I was upset during it but we remained friends after still.

Sometime later my ex wanted to get back with me but I didn't really want to, but being friends was ok, sometimes my ex would push boundaries a bit and I'd not stop them but overall it wasn't attention I wanted. I think I mostly remained friends because of how long we were together and felt like removing each other from our lives would be difficult and we liked being friends overall. 

Well sometime last year I got a new partner and my partner had me remove bad influences from my life that I desperately needed to do, one of who was my ex. I completely ghosted my ex and despite my ex trying to contact me asking what's wrong, am I okay, how they wanted to remain friends with me cause I'm important to them, I never did respond.

Sometimes I consider messaging the ex and explaining why I ghosted them, but at the same time it's been about a year since it all happened, been about 4 years since they've broken up with me. Should I just leave it in the past, given how long it's been? My ex has still tried to talk to me through family so I know they're not over it completely still. 

The main reason I cut them out is because they were emotionally abusive towards me at times though it was mostly because their mental health wasn't good and I was always willing to bend over backwards for them no matter what. There was one time when we were both drunk that they got physical towards me but nothing other than that incident aside from yelling at me and it always came down to it being my fault, gray area for who's it actually was. 

WIBTA if I contacted them again? I don't actually want to keep talking to them but everyone says ghosting is bad so it makes me feel worse knowing I did it to not just them, but others as well. Most of who I cut out were people my current partner said were manipulating me which is true, I was put in many uncomfortable situations that I didn't know exactly how to get out of and figured that's how life is for me and dealt with it rather than making it stop. 

Tldr, WIBTA if I contacted my ex to explain why I ghosted?",wanting to explain,,"I work at a place on the overnight shift. There are a few people at this place that honestly should have been fired years ago. A little information, I work at a place that has two separate buildings. I am in the second building and this person called Joe is in the first building. I've been warned about how lazy Joe is, and I've seen some of it. 
So tonight I get in at midnight and check in at the front desk to be logged in. I see he is asleep at the front desk. (for overnight shifts, sometimes people sleep but  not until 3 or 4 when all the work is done). I go to my spot in the second building. 
Around one in the morning I am told I had to get something for someone in the first building. The second person in the main building is older and can't go up and down steps well. the materials I had to get were downstairs. I go into the drawer next to joe, grab the keys and get the stuff. Im irritated at this point. Why was I called over when he was just as capable of doing this? He was awake at this point, I would like to add, and watching something on his laptop. 
I go back upstairs after locking up and put the keys in the drawer and look him in the face and calmly say, ""If someone else needs this item, you need to get it. I'm not walking back and forth between buildings like this all night."" He looks at me as though I just cussed him out. 
""Who do you think you're talking to?"" He yells. I walk out, not wanting to have started an argument. I thought he was just going to shrug it off and ignore me like he usually does to people. He keeps calling after me like that until im outside. I walk back to the second building and see my friend/coworker in her car and stop to talk to her and tell her how frustrated I was. She thought it was funny and was glad I told him that. Until he comes over.
He rushes me, screaming ""who do you think you are? you don't talk to me like that, don't disrespect me like that, you don't yell at me and slam them keys."" I calmly tell him he needs to calm down and he doesn't get to talk to me like this. He continues going on and on and screaming at me about he wasn't the one who called me over. Which I knew but I don't understand why the person sitting right next to him, never told him to do it, but called me over. 
Im now shaking and on edge. I was scared. I didn't know what the hell was going to happen and I'm scared to be alone with him especially off camera. I emailed my boss and the person in charge of this section of the organization. At first I felt justified, but now I am scared that maybe I was in the wrong. I never slammed the keys, and I never rose my voice, even when he was screaming at me. My coworker told me to tell my boss what happened. He has no business talking to me like that. I didn't mean to start a fight. Am I the asshole?",standing up for myself at work,,"About a week ago, my aunt and uncle took me to Hawaii as a little surprise vacation to celebrate my acceptance into nursing school (yay!). My uncle is an investor while my aunt owns her own bridal salon; needless to say, they’re pretty well off. And while they spared no expense for the trip, I didn’t want them paying for anything I brought back because Hawaii was amazing enough (I had to *reeally* fight them on this too).

I spent a little over $300 in total on gifts. On the last day of the trip, my mom called and asked me to buy gifts for three of my cousins because their mom had given us gift cards this year. We normally don’t celebrate xmas/exchange gifts with them, so it caught me off guard a bit. Nonetheless, I walked down to the ABC store and started looking.

My aunt had shown me another ABC outside of the hotel earlier on because they had better deals, so I decided to walk over and check it out. Low and behold, they had a magnificent 5/$20 shirt deal going on. I was also able to get 2 additional shirts for my other cousins (whom I’m very close with), so it was a win-win in my head. I even had them all pick the shirts out themselves through FaceTime to make sure they liked and would fit in them.

Fast forward to the day I get home, and my mom is fuming with anger when she finds out what I got them. She said I was cheap and selfish to spend so little on them (they gave us $20 Starbucks gift cards) and compared them to the $11 shirts I had bought for my siblings (I got them from the hotel ABC store prior to finding that wonderful 5/$20 deal at the street ABC). Then she decided that she was just going to buy entirely different gifts for them herself.

I would’ve never guessed my mom would get so worked up over something like this. For starters, she doesn’t like that aunt *at all*. Neither does most of my family (some decades-long drama), but I like my cousins just fine. I’m just not close with them, so I wasn’t planning on spending a whole lot on them. I probably should’ve gotten them an additional souvenir or something just because of the $20 vs $4 disparity, but I don’t think the shirts are a bad gift... heck, I would’ve got one for myself if I hadn’t already spent so much. I’m going to give them the shirts anyways just because I already got them, but I wanted to know if it really was an asshole move on my part?

It struck lines of communications during the Battle of the Bulge. During Operation Varsity in March 1945, it supplied ground and airborne troops near Wesel. The squadron flew its last combat mission on 25 April 1945 against Salzburg, Austria. The group had flown 273 missions and had lost 58 aircraft during the war,
.",a,"Positive. The passage describes the 704th's actions during Operation Market Garden, so we can use the operation's name as a clue to find the answer to the question.","Question: What cities did the 1st tanks division's defensive line run through? Passage: In March 1945, the 1st Tank Division with its 5th Armored Regiment was reassigned to the Japanese home islands in preparation for the expected invasion by Allied forces. It gained the IJA 1st Armored Regiment from the 3rd Tank Division, and formed part of the IJA 36th Army under the Japanese Twelfth Area Army. The headquarters unit and IJA 1st Armored Regiment were based in Sano, Tochigi, with the IJA 5th Armored Regiment stationed at Ōtawara, Tochigi (and later relocated to Kazo, Saitama, and the IJA 1st Mechanized Infantry Regiment and the Division’s mechanized artillery stationed at Tochigi. Anticipating that Allied forces would land at Kujūkuri Beach, the 1st Tank Division was to hold a defensive line stretching from Mount Tsukuba to the Tama River, with forward units deployed to Choshi, Chiba. The surrender of Japan came before the landing, and the 1st Armored Division did not see any combat on Japanese soil.
.",b,"Positive. The 1st tanks division's defensive line is mentioned in the passage, but to find the answer, one must obtain information about both ""Mount Tsukuba"" and ""Tama River"".","Question: What was the population of Los Angeles when Jarrett moved there to start screenwriting? Passage: His first feature film role was in the teen comedy ""Summer Job"", where he played an effete hairdresser. Next came minor roles in such films as The Bodyguard with Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston as well as Miami Vice and Unsolved Mysteries. His original screenplay Laws of Deception was made into a film in 1997 and starred C. Thomas Howell, James Russo and Brian Austin Green and was directed by Joey Travolta, brother of John Travolta. Jarrett had a small role in this film as Mr. Farina, a corrupt businessman.",b,Positive. The passage does not have any terms pertaining to Los Angeles. So there's no clue leading to an answer.,"Question: Which song holds the record of longest weeks at number 1 on the chart where The American Breed's greatest single reached number 5 in 1968? Passage:The group was formed in Cicero, Illinois, United States, as Gary & The Knight Lites. The founding members included Gary Loizzo (vocals and guitar), Charles Colbert, Jr. (bass guitar and vocals), Al Ciner (guitar and vocals), and Jim Michalak (drums). Early releases included- ""I'm Glad She's Mine,"" ""I Don't Need Your Help,"" ""Will You Go Steady,"" ""Take Me Back,"" among others. The group's greatest success as ""The American Breed"" was the single, ""Bend Me, Shape Me"", which reached number five on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1968. The song, written by Scott English and Larry Weiss, had previously been recorded by an all-female band known as the Shape and had been a hit on the UK Singles Chart for the British group Amen Corner. It had also been recorded by The Outsiders after they had reached the top ten with ""Time Won't Let Me"" in 1966. Contributing to the success of the American Breed's version of ""Bend Me, Shape Me"" was the excellent arrangement of the song by the band's record producer, Bill Traut, who added horns among other changes. The group also appeared on the 16 December 1967 episode of the television show American Bandstand, along with Pink Floyd.
",a,"Positive. According to the passage, the chart where The American Breed's greatest single reached number 5 in 1968 is ""U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart"". So by obtaining information about that chart, one can answer the question.","Question: How many Super Bowls did the team the Cardinals beat to make their first appearance in the Super Bowl win? Passage: The 2008 Arizona Cardinals season was the 89th season for the team in the National Football League and their 21st season in Arizona. The season marked the Cardinals' first Super Bowl appearance, coming as a result of their victory against the Philadelphia Eagles in the NFC Championship. The Cardinals slogan for the season was ""Shock The World!"" Riding the back of quarterback Kurt Warner, who had gone from being a backup for the St. Louis Rams in 1999 to leading the Greatest Show on Turf to a Super Bowl XXXIV victory, and franchise wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald, the Cardinals went on a playoff run for the ages after having won just one playoff game in the last sixty years, as Warner once again recreated the magic he had captured with the Rams. (Coincidentally, both teams were based in St Louis at one point or another, only to relocate to different cities.)
.",b,"Negative. The team that the Cardinals beat is mentioned in the passage as the Eagles, so any further information to answer the question can be obtained with one step(by getting information on the Eagles). The correct ansewr is ""a"".","Question: What margin did liberals lose to conservatives in 2010? Passage: This remained the case until the 2018 local elections when the Liberal Democrats regained one of the three seats by a single vote. The Liberal Democrats also regained control of the Council. Richmond Park, the constituency which includes Mortlake, had changed from Liberal Democrat to Conservative in the general election, was recaptured by the Liberal Democrats in the 2016 by-election, and finally reverted to Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith in the 2017 general election by a margin of only 45 votes. The London Assembly constituency South West, which includes Mortlake, is represented by former local councillor Tony Arbour (Conservative).
",a,Negative. None of the terms in the passage talk about the 2010 elections.,"Question: How old was the man who took when he took command of the Army of the Eastern Pyrenees in 1794? Passage:In the first dismal months of fighting, the Army of the Eastern Pyrenees was beaten at Mas Deu and Bellegarde and forced back under the walls of Perpignan. Then the French repelled two Spanish attacks at Perpignan and Peyrestortes. Though the army was defeated again at Truillas and in other actions, the Spanish invaders withdrew to the Tech River in late 1793. Throughout the year the representatives on mission had enormous powers and used them to interfere with the military effort and to arrest officers that they deemed unpatriotic or unsuccessful. In 1794, the army's fortunes improved when Jacques François Dugommier took command. The army drove the Spanish army from France soil at Boulou and recaptured the Fort de Bellegarde and Collioure. After establishing itself on Spanish territory, the army won a decisive victory at the Battle of the Black Mountain in November during which Dugommier was killed. His replacement, Dominique Catherine de Pérignon soon captured the Sant Ferran fortress and the port of Roses. After these events the front became static and the last notable action was a Spanish victory at Bascara in June.
",b,,"Question: When was the park built that was filmed at on July 4, 2006? Passage:After Prague, the production moved to the Bahamas. Several locations around New Providence were used for filming during February and March, particularly on Paradise Island. Footage set in Mbale, Uganda, was filmed at Black Park, a Country Park in Buckinghamshire, on 4 July 2006. Additional scenes took place at Albany House, an estate owned by golfers Ernie Els and Tiger Woods. The crew returned to the Czech Republic in April, and continued there, filming in Prague, Planá and Loket, before completing in the town of Karlovy Vary in May. A famous Czech spa, Karlovy Vary, in German known as the Karlsbad, was used as the exterior of the Casino Royale, with the Grandhotel Pupp serving as ""Hotel Splendide"". The main Italian location was Venice, where the majority of the film's ending is set. Other scenes in the latter half of the film were shot in late May and early June at the Villa del Balbianello on the shores of Lake Como. Further exterior shooting for the movie took place at properties such as the Villa la Gaeta, near the lakeside town of Menaggio.
",a,,"Question: What round was DaJuan Summers taken in teh NBA draft of 2009? Passage:The Hoyas′ previous season had been a disappointing one in which the relatively young and experienced Georgetown team had fallen from a Top Ten ranking in early January 2009 to a 16–15 finish in March that ended with the loss of 12 out of 16 games and first-round exits from both the 2009 Big East Tournament and the 2009 National Invitation Tournament. The Hoyas had lost starting forward DaJuan Summers after the end of the season when he chose to forego his senior year of college and enter the 2009 National Basketball Association draft, as well as starting guard Jessie Sapp, who graduated, and reserve guard/forward Omar Wattad, who transferred. But with freshman forwards Jerrelle Benimon and Hollis Thompson joining the team and sophomore starting center Greg Monroe, junior reserve center Henry Sims, junior starting guards Austin Freeman and Chris Wright, junior reserve forward Julian Vaughn, and sophomore reserve forward Jason Clark all returning, the Hoyas expected to bounce back in 2009–10. The preseason Associated Press Poll ranked them No. 20.
",b,,"Question: In what year did the Ford Mustang appear as a race car in the United States? Passage:Beechey began racing at the age of 22 in a Ford Customline V8. He came to prominence only a year later when he won the Olympic Touring Car Race at Albert Park, a support event at the Australian Grand Prix meeting which was held in conjunction with the 1956 Melbourne Olympic Games. As the expense of running this and two subsequent Customline V8s proved too prohibitive he reverted to a Holden 48-215 in 1959. After becoming part of David McKay’s Scuderia Veloce team he again returned to V8s, developing a Chevrolet Impala with which he won the New South Wales Touring Car Championship at Catalina Park. He progressed to a Ford Galaxie owned by Len Lukey and was then instrumental in forming the Neptune Racing Team in 1964. He raced a Holden EH S4 as part of that team alongside Jim McKeown’s Lotus Cortina and Peter Manton’s Morris Cooper S. He subsequently developed and raced a series of V8 powered Touring Cars with which he contested the Australian Touring Car Championship and other events. The first Ford Mustang to race in Australia was followed by a Chevrolet Chevy II Nova, a Chevrolet Camaro, a Holden Monaro GTS 327 and a Holden Monaro GTS 350.

A line scan diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequence with diffusion tensor analysis was applied to measure the apparent diffusion coefficient, to calculate relative anisotropy, and to delineate three-dimensional fiber architecture in cerebral white matter in preterm (n = 17) and full-term infants (n = 7). To assess effects of prematurity on cerebral white matter development, early gestation preterm infants (n = 10) were studied a second time at term. In the central white matter the mean apparent diffusion coefficient at 28 wk was high, 1.8 microm2/ms, and decreased toward term to 1.2 microm2/ms. In the posterior limb of the internal capsule, the mean apparent diffusion coefficients at both times were similar (1.2 versus 1.1 microm2/ms). Relative anisotropy was higher the closer birth was to term with greater absolute values in the internal capsule than in the central white matter. Preterm infants at term showed higher mean diffusion coefficients in the central white matter (1.4 +/- 0.24 versus 1.15 +/- 0.09 microm2/ms, p = 0.016) and lower relative anisotropy in both areas compared with full-term infants (white matter, 10.9 +/- 0.6 versus 22.9 +/- 3.0%, p = 0.001; internal capsule, 24.0 +/- 4.44 versus 33.1 +/- 0.6% p = 0.006).

BC1 RNA, an ID-related transcript, is derived from the single copy BC1 RNA gene. The BC1 RNA gene has been shown to be a master gene for ID element amplification in rodent genomes. ID elements are dispersed through a process termed retroposition. The retroposition process involves a number of potential regulatory steps. These regulatory steps may include transcription in the appropriate tissue, transcript stability, priming of the RNA transcript for reverse transcription and integration. This study focuses on priming of the RNA transcript for reverse transcription. BC1 RNA gene transcripts are shown to be able to prime their own reverse transcription in an efficient intramolecular and site-specific fashion. This self-priming ability is a consequence of the secondary structure of the 3'-unique region. The observation that a gene actively amplified throughout rodent evolution makes a RNA capable of efficient self-primed reverse transcription strongly suggests that self-priming is at least one feature establishing the BC1 RNA gene as a master gene for amplification of ID elements.","BC1 RNA, the transcript from a master gene for ID element amplification, is able to prime its own reverse transcription.",,"DNA methylation plays an important role in biological processes in human health and disease. Recent technological advances allow unbiased whole-genome DNA methylation (methylome) analysis to be carried out on human cells. Using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing at 24.7-fold coverage (12.3-fold per strand), we report a comprehensive (92.62%) methylome and analysis of the unique sequences in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from the same Asian individual whose genome was deciphered in the YH project. PBMC constitute an important source for clinical blood tests world-wide. We found that 68.4% of CpG sites and <0.2% of non-CpG sites were methylated, demonstrating that non-CpG cytosine methylation is minor in human PBMC. Analysis of the PBMC methylome revealed a rich epigenomic landscape for 20 distinct genomic features, including regulatory, protein-coding, non-coding, RNA-coding, and repeat sequences. Integration of our methylome data with the YH genome sequence enabled a first comprehensive assessment of allele-specific methylation (ASM) between the two haploid methylomes of any individual and allowed the identification of 599 haploid differentially methylated regions (hDMRs) covering 287 genes. Of these, 76 genes had hDMRs within 2 kb of their transcriptional start sites of which >80% displayed allele-specific expression (ASE). These data demonstrate that ASM is a recurrent phenomenon and is highly correlated with ASE in human PBMCs. Together with recently reported similar studies, our study provides a comprehensive resource for future epigenomic research and confirms new sequencing technology as a paradigm for large-scale epigenomics studies.",The DNA Methylome of Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells,,"Two human Golli (for gene expressed in the oligodendrocyte lineage)-MBP (for myelin basic protein) cDNAs have been isolated from a human oligodendroglioma cell line. Analysis of these cDNAs has enabled us to determine the entire structure of the human Golli-MBP gene. The Golli-MBP gene, which encompasses the MBP transcription unit, is approximately 179 kb in length and consists of 10 exons, seven of which constitute the MBP gene. The human Golli-MBP gene contains two transcription start sites, each of which gives rise to a family of alternatively spliced transcripts. At least two Golli-MBP transcripts, containing the first three exons of the gene and one or more MBP exons, are produced from the first transcription start site. The second family of transcripts contains only MBP exons and produces the well-known MBPs. In humans, RNA blot analysis revealed that Golli-MBP transcripts were expressed in fetal thymus, spleen, and human B-cell and macrophage cell lines, as well as in fetal spinal cord. These findings clearly link the expression of exons encoding the autoimmunogen/encephalitogen MBP in the central nervous system to cells and tissues of the immune system through normal expression of the Golli-MBP gene. They also establish that this genetic locus, which includes the MBP gene, is conserved among species, providing further evidence that the MBP transcription unit is an integral part of the Golli transcription unit and suggest that this structural arrangement is important for the genetic function and/or regulation of these genes.",The human myelin basic protein gene is included within a 179-kilobase transcription unit: expression in the immune and central nervous systems.,,"Glioblastomas are deadly cancers that display a functional cellular hierarchy maintained by self-renewing glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). GSCs are regulated by molecular pathways distinct from the bulk tumor that may be useful therapeutic targets. We determined that A20 (TNFAIP3), a regulator of cell survival and the NF-kappaB pathway, is overexpressed in GSCs relative to non-stem glioblastoma cells at both the mRNA and protein levels. To determine the functional significance of A20 in GSCs, we targeted A20 expression with lentiviral-mediated delivery of short hairpin RNA (shRNA). Inhibiting A20 expression decreased GSC growth and survival through mechanisms associated with decreased cell-cycle progression and decreased phosphorylation of p65/RelA. Elevated levels of A20 in GSCs contributed to apoptotic resistance: GSCs were less susceptible to TNFalpha-induced cell death than matched non-stem glioma cells, but A20 knockdown sensitized GSCs to TNFalpha-mediated apoptosis. The decreased survival of GSCs upon A20 knockdown contributed to the reduced ability of these cells to self-renew in primary and secondary neurosphere formation assays. The tumorigenic potential of GSCs was decreased with A20 targeting, resulting in increased survival of mice bearing human glioma xenografts. In silico analysis of a glioma patient genomic database indicates that A20 overexpression and amplification is inversely correlated with survival. Together these data indicate that A20 contributes to glioma maintenance through effects on the glioma stem cell subpopulation. Although inactivating mutations in A20 in lymphoma suggest A20 can act as a tumor suppressor, similar point mutations have not been identified through glioma genomic sequencing: in fact, our data suggest A20 may function as a tumor enhancer in glioma through promotion of GSC survival. A20 anticancer therapies should therefore be viewed with caution as effects will likely differ depending on the tumor type.",Targeting A20 Decreases Glioma Stem Cell Survival and Tumor Growth,,"Realizing the full potential of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) requires efficient methods for genetic modification. However, techniques to generate cell type–specific lineage reporters, as well as reliable tools to disrupt, repair or overexpress genes by gene targeting, are inefficient at best and thus are not routinely used. Here we report the highly efficient targeting of three genes in human pluripotent cells using zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN)–mediated genome editing. First, using ZFNs specific for the OCT4 (POU5F1) locus, we generated OCT4-eGFP reporter cells to monitor the pluripotent state of hESCs. Second, we inserted a transgene into the AAVS1 locus to generate a robust drug-inducible overexpression system in hESCs. Finally, we targeted the PITX3 gene, demonstrating that ZFNs can be used to generate reporter cells by targeting non-expressed genes in hESCs and hiPSCs.",Efficient targeting of expressed and silent genes in human ESCs and iPSCs using zinc-finger nucleases,,"BACKGROUND Microarrays offer great potential as a platform for molecular diagnostics, testing clinical samples for the presence of numerous biomarkers in highly multiplexed assays. In this study applied to infectious diseases, data from a microarray designed for molecular serotyping of Streptococcus pneumoniae was used, identifying the presence of any one of 91 known pneumococcal serotypes from DNA extracts. This microarray incorporated oligonucleotide probes for all known capsular polysaccharide synthesis genes and required a statistical analysis of the microarray intensity data to determine which serotype, or combination of serotypes, were present within a sample based on the combination of genes detected.   
 RESULTS We propose an empirical Bayesian model for calculating the probabilities of combinations of serotypes from the microarray data. The model takes into consideration the dependencies between serotypes, induced by genes they have in common, and by homologous genes which, although not identical, are similar to each other in sequence. For serotypes which are very similar in capsular gene composition, extra probes are included on the microarray, providing additional information which is integrated into the Bayesian model. For each serotype combination with high probability, a second model, a Bayesian random effects model is applied to determine the relative abundance of each serotype.   
 CONCLUSIONS To assess the accuracy of the proposed analysis we applied our methods to experimental data from samples containing individual serotypes and samples containing combinations of serotypes with known levels of abundance. All but two of the known serotypes of S. pneumoniae that were tested as individual samples could be uniquely determined by the Bayesian model. The model also enabled the presence of combinations of serotypes within samples to be determined. Serotypes with very low abundance within a combination of serotypes can be detected (down to 2% abundance in this study). As well as detecting the presence of serotype combinations, an approximate measure of the percentage abundance of the serotypes within the combination can be obtained.",Empirical Bayesian models for analysing molecular serotyping microarrays,

The player progresses through a series of linear missions , gradually unlocked as maps that can be freely scanned through and replayed as they are unlocked . The route to each story location on the map varies depending on an individual player 's approach : when one option is selected , the other is sealed off to the player .

There are also love simulation elements related to the game 's two main heroines , although they take a very minor role . 
 The game 's battle system , the BliTZ system , is carried over directly from Valkyira Chronicles .

Gallian Army Squad 422 , also known as "" The Nameless "" , are a penal military unit composed of criminals , foreign deserters , and military offenders whose real names are erased from the records and thereon officially referred to by numbers . Ordered by the Gallian military to perform the most dangerous missions that the Regular Army and Militia will not do , they are nevertheless up to the task , exemplified by their motto , Altaha Abilia , meaning "" Always Ready . "" The three main characters are No.7 Kurt Irving , an army officer falsely accused of treason who wishes to redeem himself ; Ace No.1 Imca , a female Darcsen heavy weapons specialist who seeks revenge against the Valkyria who destroyed her home ; and No.13 Riela Marcellis , a seemingly jinxed young woman who is unknowingly a descendant of the Valkyria . Together with their fellow squad members , these three are tasked to fight against a mysterious Imperial unit known as Calamity Raven , consisting of mostly Darcsen soldiers . 
 As the Nameless officially do not exist , the upper echelons of the Gallian Army exploit the concept of plausible deniability in order to send them on missions that would otherwise make Gallia lose face in the war . While at times this works to their advantage , such as a successful incursion into Imperial territory , other orders cause certain members of the 422nd great distress . One such member , Gusurg , becomes so enraged that he abandons his post and defects into the ranks of Calamity Raven , attached to the ideal of Darcsen independence proposed by their leader , Dahau . At the same time , elements within Gallian Army Command move to erase the Nameless in order to protect their own interests . Hounded by both allies and enemies , and combined with the presence of a traitor within their ranks , the 422nd desperately move to keep themselves alive while at the same time fight to help the Gallian war effort . This continues until the Nameless 's commanding officer , Ramsey Crowe , who had been kept under house arrest , is escorted to the capital city of Randgriz in order to present evidence exonerating the weary soldiers and expose the real traitor , the Gallian General that had accused Kurt of Treason . 
 Partly due to these events , and partly due to the major losses in manpower Gallia suffers towards the end of the war with the Empire , the Nameless are offered a formal position as a squad in the Gallian Army rather than serve as an anonymous shadow force .

During the publicity , story details were kept scant so as not to spoil too much for potential players , along with some of its content still being in flux at the time of its reveal . To promote the game and detail the story leading into the game 's events , an episodic Flash visual novel written by Fujii began release in January 2011 . The game was released January 27 , 2011 .

People who also owned the original game could transfer their save data between versions . 
 Unlike its two predecessors , Valkyria Chronicles III was not released in the west . According to Sega , this was due to poor sales of Valkyria Chronicles II and the general unpopularity of the PSP in the west . An unofficial fan translation patch began development in February 2012 : players with a copy of Valkyria Chronicles III could download and apply the patch , which translated the game 's text into English .

He praised its gameplay despite annoying limitations to aspects such as special abilities , and positively noted its shift in story to a tone similar to the first game . 
 PlayStation Official Magazine - UK praised the story 's blurring of Gallia 's moral standing , art style , and most points about its gameplay , positively noting the latter for both its continued quality and the tweaks to balance and content . Its one major criticism were multiple difficulty spikes , something that had affected the previous games . Heath Hindman of gaming website PlayStation Lifestyle praised the addition of non @-@ linear elements and improvements or removal of mechanics from Valkyria Chronicles II in addition to praising the returning gameplay style of previous games . He also positively noted the story 's serious tone . Points criticized in the review were recycled elements , awkward cutscenes that seemed to include all characters in a scene for no good reason , pacing issues , and occasional problems with the game 's AI .

Question: what is the suitable title of the passage ?", Legacy,,"Paragraph:    Valkyria Chronicles 3 was adapted into a two @-@ episode original video animation series in the same year of its release . Titled Senjō no Valkyria 3 : Taga Tame no Jūsō ( 戦場のヴァルキュリア３ 誰がための銃瘡 , lit . Valkyria of the Battlefield 3 : The Wound Taken for Someone 's Sake ) , it was originally released through PlayStation Network and Qriocity between April and May 2011 . The initially @-@ planned release and availability period needed to be extended due to a stoppage to PSN during the early summer of that year . It later released for DVD on June 29 and August 31 , 2011 , with separate "" Black "" and "" Blue "" editions being available for purchase . The anime is set during the latter half of Valkyria Chronicles III , detailing a mission by the Nameless against their Imperial rivals Calamity Raven . The anime was first announced in November 2010 . It was developed by A @-@ 1 Pictures , produced by Shinji Motoyama , directed by Nobuhiro Kondō , and written by Hiroshi Ōnogi . Sakimoto 's music for the game was used in the anime . 
 The anime 's title was inspired by the principle purpose of the Nameless : to suffer in battle for the goals of others . A subtitle attached to the project during development was "" The Road to Kubinka "" , which referenced the Kubinka Tank Museum in Moscow . The game 's main theme was how the characters regained their sense of self when stripped of their names and identities , along with general themes focused on war and its consequences . While making the anime , the production team were told by Sega to make it as realistic as possible , with the consequence that the team did extensive research into aspects such as what happened when vehicles like tanks were overturned or damaged . Due to it being along the same timeline as the original game and its television anime adaptation , the cast of Valkyria Chronicles could make appearances , which pleased the team . The opening theme , "" Akari ( Light ) -Tomoshibi- "" ( 灯 @-@ TOMOSHIBI- ) , was sung by Japanese singer Faylan . The ending theme , "" Someday the Flowers of Light Will Bloom "" ( いつか咲く光の花 , Itsuka Saku Hikari no Hana ) , was sung by Minami Kuribayashi . Both songs ' lyrics were written by their respective artists . 
 Two manga adaptations were produced , following each of the game 's main female protagonists Imca and Riela . They were Senjō no Valkyria 3 : Namo naki Chikai no Hana ( 戦場のヴァルキュリア3 名もなき誓いの花 , lit . Valkyria of the Battlefield 3 : The Flower of the Nameless Oath ) , illustrated by Naoyuki Fujisawa and eventually released in two volumes after being serialized in Dengeki Maoh between 2011 and 2012 ; and Senjō no Valkyria 3 : -Akaki Unmei no Ikusa Otome- ( 戦場のヴァルキュリア3 -赤き運命の戦乙女- , lit . Valkyria of the Battlefield 3 -The Valkyrie of the Crimson Fate ) , illustrated by Mizuki Tsuge and eventually released in a single volume by Kadokawa Shoten in 2012 .

Three species are currently recognised: the African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), the African forest elephant (L. cyclotis), and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus).

The output should have been 'False' because you cannot answer the question given the passage. So this is a bad example.,"Passage: 'Nuclear fusion powers a star for most of its life. Initially the energy is generated by the fusion of hydrogen atoms at the core of the main-sequence star. Later, as the preponderance of atoms at the core becomes helium, stars like the Sun begin to fuse hydrogen along a spherical shell surrounding the core. This process causes the star to gradually grow in size, passing through the subgiant stage until it reaches the red giant phase. Stars with at least half the mass of the Sun can also begin to generate energy through the fusion of helium at their core, whereas more-massive stars can fuse heavier elements along a series of concentric shells. Once a star like the Sun has exhausted its nuclear fuel, its core collapses into a dense white dwarf and the outer layers are expelled as a planetary nebula. Stars with around ten or more times the mass of the Sun can explode in a supernova as their inert iron cores collapse into an extremely dense neutron star or black hole. Although the universe is not old enough for any of the smallest red dwarfs to have reached the end of their lives, stellar models suggest they will slowly become brighter and hotter before running out of hydrogen fuel and becoming low-mass white dwarfs.'. Question: 'what characteristic of helium makes it a major constituent of the pulsating star mechanism'.",False,Negative. The passage contains information about the characteristics of helium and can be used to answer the question. The answer should have been 'True'. So this is a bad example.,"Passage: 'Most archaeologists believe that Machu Picchu was constructed as an estate for the Inca emperor Pachacuti (1438 -- 1472).

The Incas built the estate around 1450 but abandoned it a century later at the time of the Spanish Conquest.

In the liner notes of the ELO compilation Flashback and elsewhere, Lynne has explained that he is singing a made-up word, 'Grooss,' which some have suggested sounds like the German expression 'Gruß.' After the song's release, so many people had misinterpreted the word as 'Bruce' that Lynne actually began to sing the word as 'Bruce' for fun at live shows.'. Question: 'in the song don bring me down who is bruce'.",True,,"Passage: 'It was fought in waters near the Philippine islands of Leyte, Samar and Luzon, from 23 -- 26 October 1944, between combined American and Australian forces and the Imperial Japanese Navy. On 20 October, United States troops invaded the island of Leyte as part of a strategy aimed at isolating Japan from the countries it had occupied in Southeast Asia, and in particular depriving Japanese forces and industry of vital oil supplies. The Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) mobilized nearly all of its remaining major naval vessels in an attempt to defeat the Allied invasion but was repulsed by the U.S. Navy's Third and Seventh fleets. The IJN failed to achieve its objective, suffered heavy losses, and never sailed to battle in comparable force thereafter.

"In this task, you're given a fill-in-the-blank question that contains two object names. Additionally, you're given one answer which is one of the objects present in the question. In this task, you need to minimally change the given question so that the answer flips to another object in the question. Remember the question has to be about both objects which are related but different; for example, ""trophy"" and ""suitcase"". This task typically involves replacing one word i.e., the 'trigger word' with its antonym (e.g., changing from ""small"" to ""big""). You should not change any content in the given question beyond a word or two, i.e., the trigger word/phrase. The expected answer to your question must not be associated with just the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in the question. The expected answer should not be ambiguous. For your question, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. In your generated question, retain the object names from the input question. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in generating your modified question e.g. this task can be always solved using a simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase the word diversity. Your question must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Your question must have at least 70% overlapping words with the given question. You must utilize the given context word while writing the question. Your question must contain only one blank. The two objects should be used ONCE in your question. Here is a list of attributes and associated contrastive words that may help write contrastive trigger words. Note that contrastive trigger words help in flipping the label.

"In this task you need to indicate the plausibility of reasoning for the pronoun coreference relations. Each of the provided inputs contains a sentence with a target pronoun and a sentence that justifies which noun phrase the pronoun refers to. Correct reasons do not need to use all the knowledge from the sentence. The resolution of the pronoun coreference relations typically involve one or multiple following knowledge types about commonsense: First: 'Property', the knowledge about property of objects (e.g., ice is cold). Second: 'Object', the knowledge about objects (e.g., cats have ears). Third: 'Eventuality', the knowledge about eventuality (e.g., 'wake up' happens before 'open eyes').

I had many goes or I had many go's or I had many gos 
Answer: The dictionaries I've checked seem to be unanimous that the plural of the noun 'go' is 'goes'. I didn't see one list its plural as 'gos'. However, I didn't check all dictionaries. American Heritage Dictionary: n. pl. goes Collins Dictionary: n, pl goes Merriam-Webster Dictionary: plural goes Cambridge Dictionary: plural goes Random House Unabridged Dictionary (dictionary.com): plural goes Google NGram Viewer does not show any results for 'two gos at' or 'two gos at', but does when written as 'goes'. A Google search shows the following results: 'two gos at' = 453 results. 'two goes at' = 19,500 results. 'three gos at' = 252 results. 'three goes at' = 20,200 results. Note that both Google search and Ngram Viewer may show false positives, as Google search, as far as I know, doesn't take punctuation into account when giving search results, ie., full stops, commas. But I think it's safe to assume the consensus is that the plural of go (attempt or try) is 'goes'. I think this is a good question, as somewhere in my head I have an instinct to write it 'gos'. However the answer is gotten easily by checking some dictionaries. Also, if you wrote 'I had three gos at it before giving up', I have a feeling the typical reader probably wouldn't even be surprised by it or notice it particularly as wrong. This is just my opinion. I have this feeling because the '-os'/'-oes' plural ending rules are wildly inconsistent. Potatoes, tomatoes and heroes are correct. But 'photos' and 'burritos' are correct. However most dictionaries seem to list either '-os' or '-oes' ending as acceptable in 'ghetto' and 'mosquito'. Both 'mosquito' and 'burrito' most likely come from Spanish, yet most dictionaries say only 'mosquito' can have plural ending either '-os' or 'oes', whereas they're consistent in listing '-os' for burrito plural. Same goes for 'canto', 'manifesto' and 'grotto'. These words most likely come from Italian, yet the plural of 'canto' is 'cantos', whereas the dictionaries say the plural of 'grotto' or 'manifesto' can end in either '-os' or '-oes'. Addendum As some people have claimed that the rules for -os or -oes plural endings are quite consistent (and I happen to disagree), I've included more examples to show just how unpredictable this can get. The claim generally is basically that borrowed words or imported words from other languages have -os as their endings and most everything else has -oes. The more specific claim is this rule applies for words from Romance languages specifically. embargo (Spanish): Dictionaries show only -oes plural. NGrams show -oes much more common. tornado (Spanish): Dictionaries show either -os or -oes plural. NGrams shows -oes much more common. desperado (Spanish): Dictionaries show either -os or -oes plural. NGrams shows -oes more common. cargo (Spanish) plural possibly as the pants: Dictionaries show either -os or -oes. NGrams shows -oes more common. mango (Portuguese): Dictionaries show both -os or -oes. NGrams shows -oes much more common. domino (uncertain exactly which language, but a Romance one, or maybe directly from Latin): Dictionaries give either -os or -oes. NGrams shows -oes much more common. volcano (Italian): Dictionaries give either -os or -oes. NGrams shows -oes much more common. motto (Italian): Dictionaries give either -os or -oes. NGrams shows -oes to be more common. Words taken directly from Latin many times have -oes plural ending, but not always: veto has plural vetoes torpedo has plural torpedoes However memento overwhelmingly has plural mementos. And embryo is always embryos. Echo, directly from Greek, has plural 'echoes'. hello (native English): Nearly always 'hellos'. no (native English): Much more common as 'nos', ie., 'yeses and nos'. do (native English): Dictionaries give plural as either 'dos' or 'do's'. The results for searches of these terms would be confounding to say the least. weirdo (native English): some dictionaries show both -os or -oes. NGrams shows -os is much more popular Unknown origin: hobo: Dictionaries give either -os or -oes. NGrams show roughly same frequency. gizmo: = Dictionaries only give -os, 'gizmoes' doesn't show anything in NGrams. gazebo: Dictionaries show both -os or -oes. NGrams shows -os more common.

Answer: No. While similar, they have some important differences. Consider this note on usage from the Oxford Dictionaries: The words egoism and egotism are frequently confused, as though interchangeable, but there are distinctions worth noting. Both words derive from Latin ego ('I'), the first-person singular pronoun. Egotism, the more commonly used term , denotes an excessive sense of self-importance, too-frequent use of the word 'I,' and general arrogance and boastfulness. Egoism, a more subtle term , is perhaps best left to ethicists, for whom it denotes a view or theory of moral behavior in which self-interest is the root of moral conduct. An egoist, then , might devote considerable attention to introspection, but could be modest about it, whereas an egotist would have an exaggerated sense of the importance of his or her self-analysis, and would have to tell everyone.",no,"Negative.

The kilogram-force leads to an alternate, but rarely used unit of mass: the metric slug (sometimes mug or hyl) is that mass that accelerates at 1 m·s−2 when subjected to a force of 1 kgf. The kilogram-force is not a part of the modern SI system, and is generally deprecated; however it still sees use for some purposes as expressing aircraft weight, jet thrust, bicycle spoke tension, torque wrench settings and engine output torque. Other arcane units of force include the sthène, which is equivalent to 1000 N, and the kip, which is equivalent to 1000 lbf. Question: What seldom used term of a unit of force equal to 1000 pound s of force?",kip,"Negative. The output of this task must be True or False. In this task, you do not have to answer the question.

The user's default browser can distribute a Metro-style web browser in same package as the desktop version, which has access to functionality unavailable to other apps, such as being able to permanently run in the background, use multiple background processes, and use Windows API code instead of WinRT (allowing for code to be re-used with the desktop version, while still taking advantage of features available to Windows Store apps, such as charms). Microsoft advertises this exception privilege ""New experience enabled"" (formerly ""Metro-style enabled""). Question: What term did Microsoft give to its exception privilige for file browsing?",False,"Negative. The passage talks about ""New experience enabled"" exception privilege for web browser. Whereas in question, this entity is replaced with 'file browser', which makes it unanswerable from the passage. Therefore, the answer should be False.","Passage: In addition to a spoken standard and a closely related written standard, Czech has several regional dialects primarily used in rural areas by speakers less proficient in other dialects or standard Czech. During the second half of the twentieth century, Czech dialect use began to weaken. By the early 1990s dialect use was stigmatized, associated with the shrinking lower class and used in literature or other media for comedic effect. Increased travel and media availability to dialect-speaking populations has encouraged them to shift to (or add to their own dialect) standard Czech. Although Czech has received considerable scholarly interest for a Slavic language, this interest has focused primarily on modern standard Czech and ancient texts rather than dialects. Standard Czech is still the norm for politicians, businesspeople and other Czechs in formal situations, but Common Czech is gaining ground in journalism and the mass media. Question: How many regional dialects does Czech have?",True,"Negative. The answer to given question is 'several', which can be determined from the first sentence of the paragraph ""In addition to a spoken standard and a closely related written standard, Czech has several regional dialects primarily used in rural areas by speakers less proficient in other dialects or standard Czech"". Since this question is answerable, the output must be True.","Passage: There are also several smaller freight operators and numerous tourist railways operating over lines which were once parts of a state-owned system. Victorian lines mainly use the 1,600 mm (5 ft 3 in) broad gauge. However, the interstate trunk routes, as well as a number of branch lines in the west of the state have been converted to 1,435 mm (4 ft 8 1⁄2 in) standard gauge. Two tourist railways operate over 760 mm (2 ft 6 in) narrow gauge lines, which are the remnants of five formerly government-owned lines which were built in mountainous areas. Question: What gauge of rail lines do two tourist lines use?",True,,"Passage: Harvard has the largest university endowment in the world. As of September 2011[update], it had nearly regained the loss suffered during the 2008 recession. It was worth $32 billion in 2011, up from $28 billion in September 2010 and $26 billion in 2009. It suffered about 30% loss in 2008-09. In December 2008, Harvard announced that its endowment had lost 22% (approximately $8 billion) from July to October 2008, necessitating budget cuts. Later reports suggest the loss was actually more than double that figure, a reduction of nearly 50% of its endowment in the first four months alone. Forbes in March 2009 estimated the loss to be in the range of $12 billion. One of the most visible results of Harvard's attempt to re-balance its budget was their halting of construction of the $1.2 billion Allston Science Complex that had been scheduled to be completed by 2011, resulting in protests from local residents. As of 2012[update], Harvard University had a total financial aid reserve of $159 million for students, and a Pell Grant reserve of $4.093 million available for disbursement. Question: What amount did Harvard cut from their 2012 financial aid reserve?",False,

"In this task, you are given two questions about a domain. Your task is to combine the main subjects of the questions to write a new, natural-sounding question. For example, if the first question is about the tallness of the president and the second question is about his performance at college, the new question can be about his tallness at college. Try to find the main idea of each question, then combine them; you can use different words or make the subjects negative (i.e., ask about shortness instead of tallness) to combine the subjects. The questions are in three domains: presidents, national parks, and dogs. Each question has a keyword indicating its domain. Keywords are ""this national park"", ""this dog breed"", and ""this president"", which will be replaced with the name of an actual president, a national park, or a breed of dog. Hence, in the new question, this keyword should also be used the same way. Do not write unnatural questions. (i.e., would not be a question someone might normally ask about domains). Do not write open-ended or subjective questions. (e.g., questions that can be answered differently by different people.)

 Schmidt's selection comes more than 10 months after Obama declared cyber security a priority and ordered a broad administration review.
 A senior White House official said Obama was personally involved in the selection process and chose Schmidt because of his unique background and skills. Schmidt will have regular and direct access to the president for cyber security issues  the official said. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the selection process.
 At the same time  cyber experts and potential job candidates have complained that the position lacks the budgetary and policy-making authority needed to be successful. Schmidt will report to the National Security Council and closely support the National Economic Council on cyber issues.
 Schmidt's selection suggests that economic and business interests in the White House held more sway in the selection process.

","House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi declined to say whether  her longtime colleague Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.)  should resign from the chamber as  he  faces sexual harassment allegations.
âWe are strengthened by due process. Just because someone is accused â was it one accusation or is it two?  â¦ John Conyers  is an icon in our country.  He  has done a great deal to protect women â Pelosi told Chuck Todd Sunday on NBC Newsâ Meet the Press. âAs  John  reviews  his  case  I believe  he  will do the right thing.â
The House Ethics Committee launched an investigation into  Conyers â conduct following a report that  he  had sexually harassed a former staffer. Pelosi was among the Democrats to call for that investigation and  Conyers  said  he  would fully cooperate.
 Conyers  announced shortly after Pelosiâs interview Sunday that  he  was stepping down from  his  position as ranking chairman of the House Judiciary Committee while the ethics committee investigates  his  conduct. In a statement following that announcement  Pelosi said that the power of a legacy should not undermine the legitimacy of sexual harassment claims. âZero tolerance means consequences â she said.
Buzzfeed reported on Nov. 20 that  Conyers  had reached a settlement that exceeded $27 000 with a former staffer who alleged that the congressman had sexually harassed her and she was fired because she rejected his advances.The following day  Buzzfeed reported that another of  Conyers â former staffers had tried to sue  him  for making sexual overtures toward her and creating a hostile work environment  but the former staffer withdrew the claim when the court would not let the complaint remain sealed.

Conyers Should Resign,,"NEW YORK (AP) -- Pfizer Inc. said Friday it is pulling its blood pressure drug Thelin off the market and stopping all clinical trials because the drug can cause fatal liver damage.
 Thelin is sold in the European Union  Canada  and Australia as an oral treatment for severe pulmonary arterial hypertension  or high blood pressure in the pulmonary artery. Pfizer said a review of data from clinical trials and post-marketing reports showed a new link to liver injury. It also consulted with experts about the link between Thelin and the deaths of two patients.
 Liver damage was a known side effect of Thelin and similar drugs  the company said. Pfizer said the withdrawal was voluntary and added that it has withdrawn its filing for marketing approval in the U.S.
 Since there are other treatment options  Pfizer said the benefits of Thelin don't outweigh the risks. It is stopping all studies of the oral drug  which Pfizer acquired in 2008 when it bought Encysive Pharmaceuticals Inc. Encysive had been trying to win marketing approval for Thelin since 2005  but the Food and Drug Administration said it was not effective enough. Other agencies only approved the drug for hypertension that was so debilitating that patients' physical activity was severely limited.

Passage: John Ford (1894–1973) was an American film director whose career spanned from 1913 to 1971. During this time he directed more than 140 films. Born in Maine, Ford entered the filmmaking industry shortly after graduating from high school with the help of his older brother, Francis Ford, who had established himself as a leading man and director for Universal Studios. After working as an actor, assistant director, stuntman, and prop man – often for his brother – Universal gave Ford the opportunity to direct in 1917. Initially working in short films, he quickly moved into features, largely with Harry Carey as his star. In 1920 Ford left Universal and began working for the Fox Film Corporation. During the next ten years he directed more than 30 films, including the westerns The Iron Horse (1924) and 3 Bad Men (1926), both starring George O'Brien, the war drama Four Sons and the Irish romantic drama Hangman's House (both 1928 and both starring Victor McLaglen). In the same year of these last two films, Ford directed his first all-talking film, the short Napoleon's Barber. The following year he directed his first all-talking feature, The Black Watch.

Passage: In most cases, Tony Hulman would give the command, then ride in the pace car during the pace laps. Mary F. Hulman would give the command near the pace car, but rarely rode in the pace car due to her age and declining health. Eventually, the location was moved to near the start/finish line, and in 2001, it was moved to the new Victory Podium stage adjacent to the Pagoda. In 2011 only, Mari George moved back to the front of the starting grid to give the command, and then she rode in the pace car with A. J. Foyt. In 2014, as a special gesture to Jim Nabors's final performance at Indy, the starting command was given in unison by both Mari George and Nabors, marking the first time a non-member of the Hulman-George family had given the command for the 500 since 1954. In 2016 for the 100th Indianapolis 500, now-matriarch Mari was joined by three subsequent generations of the Hulman-George family, who gave the command together. Due to her advanced age, the 2016 race would be Mari's final turn giving the command. Later that same year, Tony George gave the starting command for the Brickyard 400, his first time giving a command since a restart command in 1986. For the 2017 Indianapolis 500, the duty was permanently assigned to Tony George. In that year, Tony George began using the phrase ""Drivers, start your engines"" instead of the more familiar ""Lady and gentlemen..."" variation. However, for the 2019 race, George recited that latter variation.

Mari Hulman George gave the starting command at the Indy 500 in 2016 so only information about her is needed.,"Question: How many Super Bowls did the team the Cardinals beat to make their first appearance in the Super Bowl win? Passage: The 2008 Arizona Cardinals season was the 89th season for the team in the National Football League and their 21st season in Arizona. The season marked the Cardinals' first Super Bowl appearance, coming as a result of their victory against the Philadelphia Eagles in the NFC Championship. The Cardinals slogan for the season was ""Shock The World!"" Riding the back of quarterback Kurt Warner, who had gone from being a backup for the St. Louis Rams in 1999 to leading the Greatest Show on Turf to a Super Bowl XXXIV victory, and franchise wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald, the Cardinals went on a playoff run for the ages after having won just one playoff game in the last sixty years, as Warner once again recreated the magic he had captured with the Rams. (Coincidentally, both teams were based in St Louis at one point or another, only to relocate to different cities.)

Passage: In 1998 the Colts, for the 4th time in 15 years, held the 1st overall pick in the draft and for the 3rd time in 15 years selected a quarterback – this time Peyton Manning. Manning started the first game of his rookie season and started every single Colts game since until the start of the 2011 season, when a recurring neck injury sidelined him. Despite a difficult rookie season, where he threw a league high 28 interceptions, Manning and the Colts responded by finishing 13–3 in 1999. The 10 game turnaround from the previous year set an NFL record. Even with this turnaround, the Colts lost in the playoffs. The following years would be marked by a near constant pattern. The Colts and Manning successes in the regular season were matched only by their failures in the post season. Manning was named to the Pro Bowl in 1999, 2000, 2002, 2003 and 2004, as well as winning the NFL MVP award in both 2003 and 2004. In 2004 Manning set a then NFL record when he threw 49 touchdowns in a single season. In spite of this the team failed in the playoffs, including early round exits in 1999, 2000, 2002 and 2005. In both 2003 and 2004 the Colts would lose to eventual Super Bowl winning New England Patriots in the AFC Championship Game and the Divisional Round respectively. In 2006 the Colts and Manning were finally able to beat the Patriots and their quarterback Tom Brady in the AFC Championship Game on their way to a victory in Super Bowl XLI against the Chicago Bears. Manning was named the Super Bowl MVP. The Colts and Manning would continue to have success, with Manning winning two further MVP awards in 2008 and 2009. In 2009 the Colts would return to the Super Bowl where they would lose to the New Orleans Saints.

Passage:It was founded around 1072 as a Benedictine priory by William FitzOsbern and his son Roger de Breteuil, 2nd Earl of Hereford. FitzOsbern had been granted the Lordship of Striguil by his second cousin King William in gratitude for his support in the Norman conquest of England, and was responsible for starting the building of a new castle overlooking the River Wye on the border with the kingdoms of Wales. At the same time he established a nearby monastic cell, so as to collect rent from the lands within Gwent which he had granted to his home Priory of Cormeilles in Normandy. By the early 12th century, the monastic establishment, on a ridge overlooking the river about 300 metres from the castle, had the status of an alien priory in its own right, though it probably never held more than about 12 monks. It superseded an earlier Augustinian priory located about 2 km away, which was dedicated to the Welsh saint Cynfarch (or St. Kingsmark), a disciple of St. Dyfrig.
",b,,"Question: What year was the song Shaft performed at the Academy Awards? Passage:The episode was written by Nell Scovell and directed by Wes Archer. In the episode, Bart and Lisa sneak into the sushi bar's karaoke room and sing the theme song to the 1971 film Shaft, ""Theme from Shaft"". The Fox network censors originally did not want the staff to use the song because they thought the lyrics were too obscene for television. In order to prove the censors wrong and show that it could appear on television, the staff dug up footage from an old Academy Awards ceremony at which the song was performed by Isaac Hayes. When the chef at the sushi bar finds out Homer has been poisoned, he yells at his apprentices in Japanese. The staff wanted the language they spoke to be actual Japanese, so they hired a Japanese actor who translated the lines for them. The episode introduced the character Akira, who has appeared many times later on the show. American actor George Takei provided the voice of Akira, although the character was voiced in later episodes by Hank Azaria. The episode featured many other guest appearances; Larry King as himself; Sab Shimono as the sushi bar chef; Joey Miyashima as Toshiro, the apprentice chef who slices up the fugu; and Diane Tanaka as hostess of the bar. King's role was first offered to American singer Bruce Springsteen, but he turned it down. According to showrunner Sam Simon, actor William Shatner also rejected the part.

Passage:In 2006, Rossum appeared in Poseidon, Wolfgang Petersen's remake of the disaster film The Poseidon Adventure. She played Jennifer Ramsey, the daughter of Kurt Russell's character. Rossum described the character as being proactive and strong in all situations, rather than a damsel in distress. Rossum also appeared as Juliet Capulet in a 2006 Williamstown Theatre Festival production of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. In early 2009, Rossum appeared in Dragonball Evolution. Her next big screen venture was the indie Dare which was an official selection of the 2009 Sundance Film Festival.

Passage:He was replaced at Ferrari by Austrian Gerhard Berger for and he moved to McLaren as number two driver behind double and reigning World Champion Alain Prost. McLaren weren't as competitive in 1987 as they had been in 1984–1986, with Prost only adding three wins to his tally (and beating the record of 27 Grand Prix wins held by Jackie Stewart with his 28th win in Portugal) and failing to successfully defend his Drivers' Championship. Further podium finishes did follow for the Swede and Johansson finished sixth in the Drivers' Championship. Stefan Johansson's position at McLaren was considered by many as just a stop gap signing by team boss Ron Dennis who had failed to lure Ayrton Senna from Lotus due to him being under contract until the end of 1987 and always intended signing the Brazilian for . Johansson famously finished the 1987 German Grand Prix on three wheels having had a puncture on the last lap. He also finished second behind Prost in Belgium and added further podium finishes in Brazil, Spain and Japan. Despite 11 podiums in three seasons, Johansson was still winless and was not wanted by a top team (he had hoped to join Williams in 1988 as a replacement for the departing 1987 World Champion Nelson Piquet but Williams signed Riccardo Patrese instead).

 context: From their original homelands in Scandinavia and northern Europe, Germanic tribes expanded throughout northern and western Europe in the middle period of classical antiquity; southern Europe in late antiquity, conquering Celtic and other peoples; and by 800 CE, forming the Holy Roman Empire, the first German Empire. However, there was no real systemic continuity from the Western Roman Empire to its German successor which was famously described as not holy, not Roman, and not an empire, as a great number of small states and principalities existed in the loosely autonomous confederation. Although by 1000 CE, the Germanic conquest of central, western, and southern Europe (west of and including Italy) was complete, excluding only Muslim Iberia.

The account of his travels, Il milione (or, The Million, known in English as the Travels of Marco Polo), appeared about the year 1299. Some argue over the accuracy of Marco Polo's accounts due to the lack of mentioning the Great Wall of China, tea houses, which would have been a prominent sight since Europeans had yet to adopt a tea culture, as well the practice of foot binding by the women in capital of the Great Khan. Some suggest that Marco Polo acquired much of his knowledge through contact with Persian traders since many of the places he named were in Persian.",No,,"proper question: In what part of the United States did many students migrate to Christian academies during the desegregation period?

Since the 1970s, many of these segregation academies have shut down, although some continue to operate.[citation needed]",Yes,,"proper question: When was the Germany Pitsudski war fought? 
 disfluent question: Who, no i meant to say, when was the Germany Pitsudski war fought? 
 context: Warsaw was occupied by Germany from 4 August 1915 until November 1918. The Allied Armistice terms required in Article 12 that Germany withdraw from areas controlled by Russia in 1914, which included Warsaw. Germany did so, and underground leader Piłsudski returned to Warsaw on 11 November and set up what became the Second Polish Republic, with Warsaw the capital. In the course of the Polish-Bolshevik War of 1920, the huge Battle of Warsaw was fought on the eastern outskirts of the city in which the capital was successfully defended and the Red Army defeated. Poland stopped by itself the full brunt of the Red Army and defeated an idea of the export of the revolution.",No,,"proper question: What is the highest reference hospital in all of Poland?

This statement ""A Neural Local Coherence Model"" is taken from the subtext ""convolutional neural network"" and its explanation in the passage. This is a positive example because the title belongs to the mentions in the passage","We present four methods for recovering the epipolar geometry from images of smooth surfaces. In the existing methods for recovering epipolar geometry corresponding feature points are used that cannot be found in such images. The first method is based on finding corresponding characteristic points created by illumination (ICPM illumination characteristic points method). The second method is based on correspondent tangency points created by tangents from epipoles to outline of smooth bodies (OTPM outline tangent points method). These two methods are exact and give correct results for real images, because positions of the corresponding illumination characteristic points and corresponding outline are known with small errors. But the second method is limited either to special type of scenes or to restricted camera motion. We also consider two more methods which are termed CCPM (curve characteristic points method, green curves are used for this method on Figures) and CTPM (curve tangent points method, red curves are used for this method on Figures), for searching epipolar geometry for images of smooth bodies based on a set of level curves (isophoto curves) with a constant illumination intensity. The CCPM method is based on searching correspondent points on isophoto curves with the help of correlation of curvatures between these lines. The CTPM method is based on property of the tangential to isophoto curve epipolar line to map into the tangential to correspondent isophoto curves epipolar line. The standard method termed SM (standard method, blue curves are used for this method on Figures) and based on knowledge of pairs of the almost exact correspondent points, has been used for testing of these two methods. The main technical contributions of our CCPM method are following. The first of them consists of bounding the search space for epipole locations. On the face of it, this space is infinite and unbounded. We suggest a method to partition the infinite plane into a finite number of regions. This partition is based on the desired accuracy and maintains properties that yield an efficient search over the infinite plane. The second is an efficient method for finding correspondence between points of two closed isophoto curves and finding homography, mapping between these two isophoto curves. Then this homography is corrected for all possible epipole positions with the help of evaluation function. A finite subset of solution is chosen from the full set given by all possible epipole positions. This subset includes fundamental matrices giving local minimums of evaluating function close to global minimum. Epipoles of this subset lie almost on straight line directed parallel to parallax shift. CTPM method was used to find the best solution from this subset. Our method is applicable to any pair of images of smooth objects taken under perspective projection models, as long as assumption of the constant brightness is taken for granted.

WSD was recently addressed as a combinatorial optimization problem in which the goal is to find a sequence of senses that maximize the semantic relatedness among the target words. In this article, a novel algorithm for solving the WSD problem called D-Bees is proposed which is inspired by bee colony optimization (BCO) where artificial bee agents collaborate to solve the problem. The D-Bees algorithm is evaluated on a standard dataset (SemEval 2007 coarse-grained English all-words task corpus) and is compared to simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, and two ant colony optimization techniques (ACO). It will be observed that the BCO and ACO approaches are on par. 1 ar X iv :1 40 5. 14 06 v1 [ cs .C L ] 6 M ay 2 01 4",D-Bees: A Novel Method Inspired by Bee Colony Optimization for Solving Word Sense Disambiguation,"Positive.

It is an important step towards understanding the meaning of a natural language. There exists SRL systems for well-studied languages like English, Chinese or Japanese but there is not any such system for the Vietnamese language. In this paper, we present the first SRL system for Vietnamese with encouraging accuracy. We first demonstrate that a simple application of SRL techniques developed for English could not give a good accuracy for Vietnamese. We then introduce a new algorithm for extracting candidate syntactic constituents, which is much more accurate than the common node-mapping algorithm usually used in the identification step. Finally, in the classification step, in addition to the common linguistic features, we propose novel and useful features for use in SRL. Our SRL system achieves an F1 score of 73.53% on the Vietnamese PropBank corpus. This system, including software and corpus, is available as an open source project and we believe that it is a good baseline for the development of future Vietnamese SRL systems.",History of Vietnamese language,"Negative.

In this setting, arms may not be comparable, and there may be several (incomparable) optimal arms. We propose an algorithm, UnchainedBandits, that efficiently finds the set of optimal arms of any poset even when pairs of comparable arms cannot be distinguished from pairs of incomparable arms, with a set of minimal assumptions. This algorithm relies on the concept of decoys, which stems from social psychology. For the easier case where the incomparability information may be accessible, we propose a second algorithm, SlicingBandits, which takes advantage of this information and achieves a very significant gain of performance compared to UnchainedBandits.

Additionally, the market dynamics provides a sensible algorithm for optimising the global objective.

This paper presents a convolutional timedelay deep neural network structure (CT-DNN) for speaker feature learning. Our experimental results on the Fisher database demonstrated that this CT-DNN can produce highquality speaker features: even with a single feature (0.3 seconds including the context), the EER can be as low as 7.68%.

The authors analyzed 271 cases of ventricular fibrillation managed by EMT-Ds working without paramedic back-up. Of 111 patients initially converted to organized rhythms, 19 (17%) refibrillated, 11 (58%) of whom were reconverted to perfusing rhythms, including nine of 11 (82%) who had spontaneous pulses prior to refibrillation. Among patients initially converted to organized rhythms, hospital admission rates were lower for patients who refibrillated than for patients who did not(53% versus 76%, P = NS), although discharge rates were virtually identical (37% and 35%, respectively). Scene-to-hospital transport times were not predictively associated with either the frequency of refibrillation or patient outcome. Defibrillation-trained EMTs can effectively manage refibrillation with additional shocks and are not at a significant disadvantage when paramedic back-up is not available.

Recent reports have re-introduced this concept and confirmed its safety and ready accessability for fluid and drug administration. However, these reports have not addressed the difficulties encountered during insertion of the intraosseous needle. Spinal needles, standard metal intravenous (IV) needles, and bone marrow biopsy needles have been suggested for intraosseous infusion. These needles were tested for ease of insertion on a pediatric cadaver leg. The site for needle placement was also evaluated during the study. It was found that the 13-gauge Kormed/Jamshidi disposable bone marrow/aspiration needle was the easiest to insert and did not plug with bone or tissue during insertion. An area proximal to the medial malleolus was found to provide a stable, relatively flat, and easily penetrable location for needle placement. This method was successfully utilized in ten pediatric and five adult patients. Intraosseous needle placement is a safe, rapid method to gain access to the venous circulation. By utilizing these techniques, a stable, usable fluid line can be established in even the most dehydrated pediatric patients.

It has long been known that arterial PO2 (PaO2) decreases during unsupplemented, non- pressurized flight. In this study, the authors examined the use of the transconjunctival oxygen (cjO2) monitor for assessing the adequacy of arterial oxygenation during helicopter flight in four healthy volunteers. Arterial PaO2 as measured by conventional blood gas analysis was compared with cjO2 at ground level, 5,000 feet, and 10,000 feet altitude. Mean PaO2 dropped significantly from 93.5 to 81.5 to 58.5 mm Hg, respectively (P less than 0.001, analysis of variance with repeated measures). Mean cjO2 also decreased significantly from 63.8 to 52.0 to 34.8 mm Hg, respectively (P less than 0.001, analysis of variance with repeated measures). Within individual subjects, cjO2 was an accurate predictor of PaO2 (P less than 0.001, multiple regression analysis). The relationship between cjO2 and PaO2 was linear with a regression coefficient of 1.147. The authors conclude that the transconjunctival O2 monitor may be useful for monitoring the adequacy of arterial oxygenation during helicopter flight in hemodynamically stable patients. The results of study also support the use of supplemental oxygen in all patients subjected to helicopter transport.

The relationship of psychiatric illness to diabetic control was studied using glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1) and self-report measures of metabolic symptoms. Seventy-one percent of the patients had a lifetime history of at least one criteria-defined psychiatric illness; affective and anxiety disorders were the most common diagnoses. A significant difference (p = .02) in mean glycosylated hemoglobin levels was observed comparing patients with a recent psychiatric illness (mean = 10.8%) to those never psychiatrically ill (mean = 9.6%). These psychiatrically ill patients also reported more symptoms of poor metabolic control and more distress associated with these symptoms than did patients never psychiatrically ill (p less than .0001 for both). The overall report of diabetes symptoms was unrelated to HbA1 (p = .25) and was influenced primarily by the recent presence of psychiatric disorder (p less than .0001). We conclude that emotional illness is associated with both poorer metabolic control and the increased report of clinical symptoms of diabetes.
